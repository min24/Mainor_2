aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,M Stewart,United Kingdom,2015-03-24,Airport is small and convenient when flights can actually leave and the check in and security I experienced were fine. The airport lounges are OK too if you are frequent flyer. However the airport is not equipped for all weather flights apparently the runway is too short so delays or cancellations due to weather (a little bit of fog) occur as happened the only 2 times I visited and I understand this is not infrequent. A taxi driver who took me to a hotel (which I paid for myself) told me that when delays occur all the local hotels are full so I had to find a hotel way out of Aberdeen. The positive side for taxi drivers is that the one who took me said he'd had a passenger who was so desperate to get to Heathrow he paid Â£1000 (yes one thousand GBP) to get there. They staff at BA with whom I'd flown are unable to cope with queues very long at desks. Its more like a third world airport in that respect. One would have thought that with the importance of the oil industry etc that arrangements would have been made to improve capacity and capability.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,S Reid,NA,2010-04-02,Avoid this airport on outbound flights in the afternoon particularly on Friday. Allow up to 1hr for the security screening process. You can pay an additional £5 to jump to the top of the security queue. I have not seen this at any other airport. Staff are friendly but another one/two security screening stations are required to cope at peak times. The luggage arrivals belt is small and if three flights land at once you scramble for your bags. On exiting the airport the smokers are just outside the door with the discarded cigarette ends on the pavement. Not a very nice welcome to Aberdeen. If you have the option avoid this airport or use it out of peak hours - not easy due to the remote location.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Jay Sitlani,United States,2015-07-14,"Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures. Etihad is a fabulous carrier, but the transit at AUH will make me think twice before I choose it for my long haul travel needs.",Transit,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,4,2,2,2,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,0

They finish it realise that is was done wrongly and re-do it. Well pretty soon someone will realise that AUH terminal 3 is wrong… It is narrow cramped with a ceiling that makes me (6ft’2”tall) uncomfortable. If you are using or planning to use Etihad and AUH as your hub please understand: this is not DXB Terminal 3. Not even a poor version of it. It feels like a toy airport. Quite unbelievable how bad it is. Even DMK (the old Bangkok airport) feels more spacious. Hope you will not need to use the toilets. They are disgusting. With Dubai and Qatar nearby I don't see the point of ever using AUH again. Etihad is not that great as an airline.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,R Jones,United Kingdom,2014-12-21,Terrible airport! For a growing carrier like Etihad and the traffic growth all around the gulf Abu Dhabi seems to be lagging behind everyone else. In terminal 3 there are 6 bag drop desks for most of the Etihad fleet (that's over 100 a/c) and around 10 normal check in desks. Average queue time can be anything from 10mins to 1hr plus. Then all the passengers move across to boarder control where of course it is chaos again. Finally when you clear immigration and security you are presented with a terrible selection of shops restaurants and cafes and no seating what so ever (unless of course you don't mind sitting on the floor or the edge of a flower bed). Then when your flight is ready to board there is a single file queue to one maybe two people checking passports. So the queue here for a B777 or A340 is 15mins+. Then you board the a/c and you are away. From the moment you enter the airport to boarding the plane it is a nightmare. I hope the new midfield terminal will be better. I cannot imagine what the A380 with 450-500 passengers is going to look like in terminal 3! I really feel sorry for those passengers. The staff are very rude and not interested in the passenger experience and queuing for security is chaos as staff are shouting almost every world city for passengers to skip the queue for imminent departures so the flow of people in the queue is limited as people skip the queue.

The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired.

Terminal 3 used exclusively by Etihad is a bit larger but again operating beyond its design capacity; with only three bathrooms and cheap cleaning contractor cleanliness is an issue mainly if you want to use the cabinets.

The process was so slow with staff leisurely processing customers at a rate of 3 minutes per person that it took 3 hours to get through.

It was bad enough dealing with ghastly food on Etihad. The food options at Terminal 3 are limited and very expensive. Also the fast food on display looked as though it was there 48 hours before. Not very pleasant at around 20 dollars for a similar meal which In London would cost less than half. A small bottle of water cost around 6 US dollars. Not many places to sit but lots of shops.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,M Taylor,United Kingdom,2012-02-09,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2010-09-19,Transfer at AUH from LHR enroute to CMB and on return journey. Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,A Fleming,Ghana,2010-06-13,I have been through Kotoka International Airport more times than I care to remember and the attached domestic terminal a couple of times. Against most other African airports I have passed through (around 30) it is at the top end and there is an evident desire to improve. The airport is relatively small has only two gates for international departures and there are an ever increasing list of carriers adding Accra to their routes. Departure is not usually too bad security keeps the majority who may bother travellers at bay. Many first time passengers do not realise the need to go to the extreme right end of the airport for a customs check before going to their check in queue. This can result in additional queuing for the uninitiated as there is no signage. There are well in excess of 20 counters so whilst it can be crowded in the evening as others mention it is not unmanageable. Passengers must go upstairs for immigration and here is the best eating place in the airport - the only problem is that is security are doing their job they may not allow your friends to come and eat with you. In this case there are a few outside eating options within a short walk of the departure area of which Airport Landing is probably the best for a full meal. Once through immigration the shopping options are limited and overpriced but there are places for drinks snacks or even small time gambling. Business passengers will according to their carrier be assigned to one of two lounges - whilst neither is spectacular the lounge used in the main by Skyteam partners is my preference. It has a view of the runway and usually some kind of food as well the usual drinks. This lounge is close to the departure gates for intercontinental flights but there are times when African flights including Kenyan are from the gate located at the other end of the airport. The other lounge is used by BA Emirates and also Star Alliance partners (South African Lufthansa and United and apparently soon to be Turkish). This has minimal food no natural light but is nicely decorated and probably has the better drinks selection. The main x-ray security is before you go to your gate and you then sit in an often poorly air conditioned room awaiting boarding - it is rare for boarding to start when they first announce that it is. These areas often have passengers from multiple flights at one time and there is some small risk of boarding the wrong plane in the chaos that can ensure. It is not the best end to the departure experience but with the limited space and an expanding range of carriers it is hard to overcome this and as others state staff are for the most part friendly and polite. On arrival immigration is normally not more than 10 or 15 minutes bags can be quick or slow like most places (though I find very slow for late night flights) and you must then go downstairs where you are likely to have your baggage tag checked to confirm you have picked up the correct item(s) of luggage. Beyond this point it can be a little chaotic - people will almost certainly offer you a taxi and try to carry your bag then put pressure on you for a tip. If you do not want any of these services it is best to smile and say so - personally I would always favour trying to arrange a reliable pick up at any unfamiliar airport and in Accra most hotels can arrange for this. The domestic terminal is fairly spartan but perfectly adequate.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
adana-airport,/airport-reviews/adana-airport,Adana Airport customer review,William Foran,NA,2007-10-04,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours.

A friend of mine was leaving with 350 birrs but 100 was confiscated. He was told that on his return customs would return the cash. This is a lie. As our flight was cancelled due to a major technical matter (Ethiopian 757 engine caught fire on take off) we were allowed to go back into the country yet when he tried to get the 100 birrs back he was told it was not possible because it now belonged to Ethiopia.

There is only one baggage carousel for international flights which makes it a problem if a large aircraft lands let alone multiple long haul flights. Customs is slow with numerous people asking you the very same questions. Perhaps they should consider having more people man the immigration booths and less customs staff. They obviously have little to do in such a small airport so are overzealous. On return check-in facilities were good friendly staff. There were many shops in the departure area which is a communal area for both international and domestic departures.

alghero-fertilia-airport,/airport-reviews/alghero-fertilia-airport,Alghero Fertilia Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-01-27,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Saturday is a busy day at ALC and we parked on a remote stand but the steps and buses arrived in a flash. The immigration hall is bit bizarre as one enters at right angles to the point of exit. There was a substantial Italian style queue but it dispersed steadily even with only one immigration officer. The baggage hall was well organised. One snag with our car hire and I believe some others is that some of the big names have slightly less obviously named partners at ALC and can be difficult to spot. For the return journey the departure and check in facilities were pleasant cool and airy. Catering has improved markedly and the El Palmeral restaurant is to be recommended landside. We have been using ALC on and off for years and this is an airport which has made the improvements it needed.

I filled one out to the best of my ability showed it to the guard and he just waved me through. My bags were checked briefly and no one looked at my form.

Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices.

A fairly sized terminal with Air Asia and Malaysian flying. Clean and very modern indeed with services and several shopping points for food. The process is fairly quick. There are only 2 gates with OK seating. The only downturn is that there is no monitor next to the gates and its not possible to see the plane on the tarmac so when we had a minor delay no one knew how much was the actual flying time and some were nervous. Otherwise very cheap flights to Kuala Lumpur- much better than a 7hrs bus ride for sure and a cheaper option to fly from BKK to southern Thailand just hop through the borders and fly to KL.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

There are hardly any places to sit and the security is very tight - which means that you might or might not be able to visit an airline office since you have to enter the area where only departing passengers are allowed. I was lucky and the guard decided to let me through to change a ticket - but gave my traveling companion a hard time. There are few places to sit the bathrooms are quite gross and it's very smoky. The only thing going for it is that the exchange counter by the visa desk offers a rate of exchange often much better than the hotels in Amman. If you are getting a taxi from the airport there are slips with pre-set rates (pretty good) which you should be given when you hire a cab - but that doesn't always happen.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The luggage carousel was in a state of total dissrepair and the bags where thrown through the hole in the wall in a rough style by unseen hands. Next was the customs which if i hadnt have been traveling with an Indian friend i would have found daunting. The money they wanted was not handed over.

Everything works at this airport the trains planes buses and shuttles. Shopping is very good. There is improvement/refurbishment going on airside to make it even better? The only negative was a very long walk after immigration to reach your gate I like the idea of security check near the boarding area as this reduces the massive bottleneck at the start of your journey.

The annoying thing is the security-at-the-gate which always annoys me but otherwise I think this airport is reasonable for it's size and location. As others have noted there is some walking required - but I don't understand people's insistence that when travelling 10000km they should not have to walk a single pace without some kind of mechanical assistance.

Queues for the automated bag drop machines were horrendous and would have been cut by maybe 75% if there had been more than one staff member allocated to help those who had not done this before. Weird system of going through security at the gate meant that people were having to abandon soft drinks they had purchased after clearing passport control and because the process of doing security at the gate is obviously time consuming people were at the gate with no access to drinks or toilets for up to an hour before they were boarded onto the aircraft and there were too few seats for the amount of passengers.,NA,NA,NA,6,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

On a recent flight from London-City airport we landed on the‘remote’runway so had to endure a 10-15 minute taxi to the gate. Once we got there the gate was stilled occupied so has to wait for another allocation (typical for this airport). Once we pulled up to the new gate we had as usual to wait for what seemed like ages for the jetty to dock with the aircraft then the endless walking and travelators to immigration added another 10 minutes to the journey. Luckily the immigration was very fast. So given a 40 minute flight from London we spent at least 35 minutes taxiing disembarking and endless walking. I don't find this airport at all suitable for shorter commuter type flights.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-03-05,I generally like Schiphol it is large and busy but well laid out and has plenty of facilities and never feels particularly crowded. I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle. In the end Schiphol worked but I found the experience unnerving and I caution transit passengers with less than hour between flights to be ready for a stressful experience.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Most recent time I used the airport two days ago I was late and arrived at the airport 2pm by train and made it at C04 at boarding 2.15pm. Security was very fast think they even upscaled a bit for the expected traffic due to Christmas. Unfortunately there was no time left to grab a bite or do some Christmas shopping but airport has sufficient places for that. In the past I have experienced once or twice (in my case <5% of times traveled through the airport) 45 minute wait for the luggage which was too long don't know what happened there the other occasion customs took too long but apparently it was a sudden peak and it took some time to call some extra staff. These two occasions however are not representing the overall performance. The walking distance are normally fine you can be unlucky when you have a stopover and need to go from H peer to B that will take a good twenty minutes.

I couldn't understand why arrivals and departures are in the same place it was a bit confusing. I spent some time at the duty free upon arrival so didn't have any queues at passport control. Very well connected with train station buses and all public transport. On departure I checked in online for my Emirates flight however I spent sometime at passport control which was long and slow with only 4 counters. Duty free staff were very friendly and helpful toilets were in very bad condition.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,D Macleod,United Kingdom,2012-10-09,There are so many good things about this airport that make it my favourite to travel through on and off for the last thirty years almost. It may be big but it is never a real chore to walk from one point to another and in many trips through the airport I have perhaps fortunately not found myself seriously having to race from one flight to another. The shops the bars and restaurants are generally of a very high standard as are the lounges and staff are generally very pleasant. I have but one criticism and that is security for flights to the UK. On my outward journey last week security check for the leg to Helsinki was fair and thorough but just a common ordinary security check; on the return journey from Amsterdam to Aberdeen the security was oppressive and obtrusive. Some staff were thoroughly unpleasant process was slow and perhaps amusingly and reassuringly the captain was forced to go through the scanner three times before he was allowed to board the flight. Nevertheless I find it strange that flights to the UK should be so much more thoroughly checked than others. Are we a greater risk or at greater risk or is this just a reaction to our not being members of the common border agreement in the EU? For all that I would still say Schipol is my favourite airport of the majors in Europe. I have noticed this disparity of treatment several times in the last few years.,NA,NA,NA,9,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

This September I departed from Schiphol four times. 3 times Schengen lounge and 1 time intercontinental. I have to say that Schiphol is becoming more and more outdated and is rapidly losing ground with major Asian competitors like HKG SIN and Seoul Incheon and Munich and Madrid in Europe. It's overcrowded congested not passenger friendly and the terminal buildings are getting old and claustrophobic. During peak times going through security on the Schengen side is like standing in line in Disney world with endless waiting cues. One time it took me over 40 minutes to pass security. For the first time I noticed how dirty it became especially the dining area above the Schengen departure hall. All tables were full of dirty plates left behind for several hours without cleaning. Food choice was also very poor. The staff tends to be arrogant and non service minded. I am also surprised how uninviting the immigration area is. A small dark corner when entering the Netherlands. Baggage claim is terrible small long wait and sometimes I feel as If I'm on a marketplace with no space at all to move. Usual wait lasts more then 30 minutes for baggage to unload and counting.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,J Cioboata,Romania,2012-08-07,Great and efficient airport. Facilities at the airport are excellent I especially enjoyed the annex of the Rijksmuseum which had very interesting paintings on display. Numerous shops to browse and plenty of eateries. One thing I missed was a proper sit-down service like. Signage and layout is easy to navigate however distances can be long but on a positive note it at least allows for healthy exercise between flights. One thing I really appreciated was that the security check is done at the gate which makes it less stressful and prevents endless queues as seen at airports with a central security check however reviewers seem to have a different opinion about it.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Self transfer counters are great still with some nice staff assisting. SKY Priority works well in all parts of the airport. Unfortunately the self-passport control gates were not working so the lines were long even in the EU zone passport holders.

The extra security check at the gate for the AMS to MSP flight was expected what was not expected was being physically hit by the Dutch equivalent of TSA. The trays for laptops passing through the metal detector are sized to handle pocket change. I was worried that my laptop would fall from the tray. I walked through the whole body scanner all the while pre-occupied with what was happening with my laptop. After exiting the body scanner I walked over to the metal detector to retrieve my laptop. Next thing I know this TSA guy is hitting me on the back and yelling 'I'm not finished with you'. I was completely surprised and taken aback. There were no signs or people waiting just after exiting the body scanner saying I should stay put. I told the TSA guy that I didn't know I had done anything wrong and he yelled again that he wasn't finished. For those Americans who constantly complain about USA TSA try flying through AMS.

The one-terminal concept is a major selling point for this airport but the airport is too large for this concept to be viable. The last time I used Schiphol the planes landed on and took off from the Polderbarn runway and this added about 20 -30 minutes to the overall journey time. Both the incoming and return flights involved a lengthy trek to Gate E. Baggage handling was fine on this occasion but is not reliable.

AMS has a few construction projects it seems. Very long immigration queue due to only 3 checkpoints for non-EU passports and one EU passports counter open in a dark unwelcoming area. The few open counters are not enough at all when the flights from SQ Delta and CX are arriving at the same time (and many others)!

There are plenty of facilities although shops are a little pricey. If you're flying to a country where you're required to go through passport control (gates E and above) then things get a little silly. The security check is at the gate which results in very slow boarding times and long queues.

Immigration took about 40 minutes bad but I have suffered worse elsewhere and the officer was polite and welcoming. Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft.

Once cleared immigration had another queue to get through customs then the worst thing is you have to recheck your baggage and go through security why when you have got off an international flight and not left the terminal do you have to go through security. All this queuing took over two hours and i made my connecting flight with minutes to spare avoid Atlanta if at all possible.

Second the customs area is too small to handle all incoming flights. Customs officials are rude and bark orders to arriving passengers.

We were fortunate enough to be traveling international Business Class so got free use of the Delta Sky Clubs. There are several in the airport but only the one in Terminal E (I believe) has showers and there are only two so there can be a wait. The train between terminals can get crowded but they are frequent. Lines for Immigration moved quickly though they didn't open until 5:30 a.m. so when our flight from Brazil arrived early (about 5:15) we had to wait on the plane until 5:30 until we could even disembark (and then there was the long walk to actually get to Immigration).

There's a live music stage in the center of the terminal and local businesses dominate the shopping scene. Much of that as other posters noted is annoying as you can't get a cheap snack and lines can be long. Shops are definitely ""Austin"" but needlessly expensive. The music is well hit and miss. I prefer quiet to some of that stuff! For the Starbuck's fans there's one in the terminal now. There are ""Austin-inspired"" murals above check-in. Great to have local artists but the art is rather pedestrian showing scenes of poor Hispanics. I think there's probably more to Austin than that. Getting in and out is easy although I have had long luggage waits. The roads and signage to the airport are OK but getting better. Seems like they built this airport without figuring out how to get to/from the place. No freeways to the place but supposedly they're working on it. Parking is not cheap but not expensive either by some standards. The cheapest is $7/day. Better to take the bus if you can if going away a long time. Car rental is usually easy. Taxi is easy. Blue Van may be a long wait and long drive as they drop off others. Early am flights (6:30am and earlier) are insane. Long long lines at security as all airlines seem to have flights at this time.

Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points.

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,J Kemp,NA,2007-12-04,Agree with other comments that while Bangalore airport is not Changi it's not the abyss described by many. Having experience explosive growth in the region with a new airport on the way it's amazing that this little military airport holds up under the pressure. There's a special charm about this airport - and while taxed by the increasing number of passengers coming through this tiny facility I think that the airport administration has done a pretty good job. Arriving from Paris at 1 AM I was through customs picked up luggage (after having to wake up the porters who were sleeping on the belt!) and into my car in 30 minutes. On the way out on a mid-afternoon flight from BLR to BOM I was checked in and through security in 10 minutes. While there was no lounge service just sitting in the main waiting area is quite an experience.

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,Kurt Müller,NA,2005-08-07,One could be forgiven for not realising that one is at the airport of what is trumpeted as India’s IT capital. Checking in with any airline using Air India’s computer terminals at BLR passengers can forget about obtaining boarding passes to their final destination if their trip involves a transfer at an intermediate point – the system cannot handle anything but the leg departing from Bangalore. The immigration desks have no scanners for swiping machine-readable passports. However there is uniformed personnel in abundance – some of them doing nothing else but checking whether their counterpart a few yards away has placed a stamp in your documents. Where they are really needed these officers do nothing. Boarding a TG flight on 7th August the procedure was a disaster. Instead of providing the announced priority to families with children and those needing special assistance (and then allowing business class passengers on first) the uniformed guard at the gate was happily (yet again) checking for the numerous stamps on boarding passes of anyone who was rude enough to push their way through (and such people are in abundance in India let me tell you). On the infrastructure side matters have deteriorated even further. Last week I witnessed the collapse of a new structure designed to hide the aircon ducts in the domestic terminal burying the Kingfisher check in desk and one of their agents under the debris. At the international departures building buying a visitor’s ticket has become a farce as passengers and visitors are now separated at the front door and have to use separate escalators. And judging by the state of the seats in the international departures lounge I wonder whether the stray dogs that are omnipresent on the apron area are allowed to use the seats during quite periods – it is simply unimaginable that humans could soil cushions to that extent – and even more so that no one seems to realize they need cleaning.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I did mention that the airport is finally listening as there are some minor changes however compared to other airports in the region it is not a comfortable event leaving or arriving at this airport. Passport control is much better than before however waiting times remain longer than optimal and the overall ""attitude"" of the border officers (male and female) can be described as miserable and lacking tact in many ways. Being 10 years here I never touched the glorified tax free shopping as items are pricier than in the city. It's just not worth it at all. Food venues are pricey however there is a food court with great food on the ground floor before you pass immigration to the restricted air side. Walking distances are very long and I cannot imagine older passengers going all that way to reach passport control. Wifi never really worked so I am wondering whether its just for show. The train to the airport from the city discontinued the red express line for some reason (it had terrible frequencies as well - every 45 minutes so it beats the overall idea of having an express train). The local blue line is alright but used by many locals on the way so gets very packed and full in just a couple of stops. My main anger with this airport is its inability to control taxi drivers. They are wilder every time. Once you are seated and left the cab booth many tourists are faced with immediate requests of a set fare that is double or triple the taxi-meter price. In several occasions people were ""offloaded"" close to the highway as a result. I discernibly see those cab drivers getting to be a problem.

Passport control officers are much faster even if they still lack common courtesy. They are more ""efficient"" nonetheless.

I've rarely had difficulties flying out of Bangkok although I do make sure I'm there well in advance of my flight times. This is a very busy airport and always seems crowded due in my opinion to the lack of seating which leads to people walking up and down the concourse while waiting for their gates to be confirmed the duty free is very expensive and most of the shops seem to offer the same range of goods. The choice of food is quite good although the eating area again tend to get very crowded as people linger long after they've finished their meals just to have somewhere to sit. As all my flights are with Qatar I know which gates are usually used I have a Qatar Privilege Club Silver card so I can check in at the business counter and usually get a fast track pass and invitation to one of the Thai business lounges.

Immigration can be a headache if you arrive around midday and in spite of 12 available aisles it can take around 30 mins to clear during peak periods. Departure is even worse and you'd be well advised to allow at least 1hr to clear immigration during peak periods in order to avoid missing your flight. Toilets are clean but there often seems to be a lack of paper hand towels. Also they don't seem to enforce the no smoking ban in the toilets and one is often greeted by the pungent smell of stale tobacco smoke. Navigating between floors can be a headache since the lift often skips a floor for no apparent reason and you end up at a different level than the intended one. Security staff subsequently refuse to allow you to use a walkway to get to the floor you intended to go to. So you're forced to return to your starting point and look for an escalator to go to the floor you actually want to reach. Only two banks available (Siam and TMB) which offer very poor exchange rates. On the plus side Thai SIM cards are available at either the AIS (1-2-Call) or DTAC (Happy) service desks on level 2. Staff will set up your mobile for you and extend the validity period if you wish to keep the same number for a subsequent visit. Provided you use the AOT taxi booths on the ground floor and pay the 50 Baht service charge you'll have no problem with the touts who hang around the upper levels looking for gullible travellers who don't know the ropes.

My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line.

I am talking about immigration. Passport control is always in chaos. There are 2 main rush hours in the airport still struggles with very slow passport control officers and less than 50% of the pass-checks open. 55minutes on departure and 45min at arrival is just unacceptable. The marketing of Suvarnabhumi is visible in the Thai media as they are achieving faster service and with a smile. I reckon most of the passport control officers flanked the lessons. All I see at the pass desk is stickers and advertising of who supplied the camera who supplied the air freshener etc. So if I can give passport control any grade lower than zero I would. Otherwise security was better and faster the so-called duty free has lost my attention for the last 6 years so I just go through still nothing of interest close to the gates and the place there looks like a barren desert waiting at gates much better with padded seats giving the place a better look always prepare for long walks at arrival to the passport controls.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

For a modern airport it is a shambles - it is hard to work out where you are going in particular from the domestic to the international terminals.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,J Klakayan,United Kingdom,2010-06-21,Beware if you're a transit passenger from domestic to international flights. The information provided and signs to follow are ludicrous. I have never yet twigged despite multiple attempts in the past 3 years. Some airlines require you to check in again at a transfer desk if you can find it. If Emirates business passenger you can get your boarding card from their lounge but impossible to find airline lounges. On arrival from abroad and business passenger walk past the customs and immigration signs immediately afterwards there are the CIP gates which you should use saving lots of queues and time. If making a domestic flight be wary of the people who ask where you are going prior to security. They are merely travel agents looking for some trade although they look very official and have nothing to do with the airport or security. Their prices are more expensive than those you could get at your destination.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
bangor-airport,/airport-reviews/bangor-airport,Bangor Airport customer review,K Ashley,United States,2012-07-09,There was one person in the whole airport who knew what was going on. The rest of them were rude and clue less. We missed our flight because they had 2 people working a very thorough security screening for a line of at least 120 passengers. It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers. They also claim they called everyone's names over the intercom. Not a single person heard their name. They said at first that we would not be able to leave until Monday (two days later) and that all flights were booked. Luckily two people cancelled on a flight for the next day and we were able to board. It was a nightmare to say the least.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It looks as though it will have a very nice landside terminal when the the work is finished and once through security the (I hope) temporary shopping arrangements will improve once the new units are finished. Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users. Overall a fairly average airport experience that will improve once the building is completed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Security was good but when I finally got airside I realised that as many airlines had moved to the new terminal 1 most of the shops and restaurants had closed down airside. In fact my walk to the M5 non Schengen boarding area which used to involve a pleasant walk down a shop and cafe lined street now involved walking down a dingy alley of boarded up shops.

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,A Williams,Spain,2010-09-21,I reviewed Barcelona airport back in December 2009 and commented then that there was a stark difference between terminals 1 and 2 in terms of facilities and shops etc. Almost a year later and some things have changed but not so much as you may think. Terminal 1 remains the main terminal for major airlines and medium to long haul flights. While the overall facilities have not changed those flying from sections D and E of this terminal will thankfully notice that catering facilities are now available. These two sections were previously cordoned off from the remainder of the terminal and once in you cannot leave. Incredibly both sections offered nothing in the way if refreshments or shopping until very recently. It's in terminal T2 however where most has changed. In an attempt to fill this white elephant with passengers the airport has sought to attract several new airlines with extremely low fees. There is no better example than the recent arrival of Ryanair; a quick look at their fees would indicate that they are operating from the airport free of charge! The result then is that T2 is now teeming with activity. On passing through today almost all checkin desks were open and the place was almost full to capacity. Unfortunately however the decline in passenger numbers in 2009 has had a drastic effect on retail outlets operating from mthis terminal. Of the around 100 or so retail and catering outlets I would guess that 80 are now in a permanent state of closure. It is quite depressing passing through the hoards at security to be greeted by row after row of boarded up shops and cafeterias. With the exception of one or two specialist outlets a couple of coffee shops and one restaurant there is literally nothing else to occupy the time. Another unusual aspect is that arrivals and checkin at terminal T2A are also now closed; all entry and exit is now via T2B. Ultimately then while it's good to see the airport attempting to increase it's passenger numbers but maybe it's a case of too little too late. If you are flying through T1 you are still going to experience a pleasant enough journey T2 on the other hand remains soulless and boring.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,A Williams,NA,2009-12-05,Barcelona airport has had quite a few makeovers in the last few years - the last being the opening of what is now terminal 1 a few months ago. Given the fact that navigating the roads leading toward the airport is difficult and unintuitive actually getting to terminal 1 is fairly easy however they now no longer allow you to drop off outside the terminal - you must park in the multi-storey (first few minutes are free). The new terminal is infinitely better that the old one - more spacious and easier to navigate and with much better eating and shopping options. However the prices are not attractive so unless you have some spare euros to get rid of then I would stick to window shopping. One bonus is the ability to shop when you arrive as well as when you depart - though when I came through a few weeks ago at around 10pm everything was closed. The old terminal (previously terminals A B and C) are now renamed Terminal 2 A B  and C an though it is large it is now all but deserted reserved almost exclusively for charter flights and budget airlines. Passing through there only this morning I noted that while Terminal 1 has around 20 flights an hour Terminal 2 has less than that a day! Of the 90 or so check-in desks we saw less than 5 open and it was clear that the shops and cafes are all running on minimum empty. Only a few weeks ago this place was still teaming with people. One good aspect of this is that parking is no longer an issue and queues are non existent. Unfortunately the biggest airline in terminal 2 - Easyjet - has relocated to terminal 2C which is itself a separate building a good 5 to 10 minute walk from terminal 2B. Our tickets still indicated terminal 2B so we joined several other passengers wandering aimlessly trying to find where Easyjet had moved to and of course with the reduction in passengers in this terminal there were no information points - or even any staff available. Terminal 2 C then was the busiest but has no facilities other than 4 vending machines and a cafe which is now closed. All in all the the distinct differences between the 2 terminals are very evident. If you are in terminal 1 you should have a nice smooth relaxing if expensive time. In terminal 2 however you may as well be in a ghost town - remember to bring your own coffee!,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The security staff simply do not understand that BA's Club Europe is Business Class and try to refuse entry to fast track. This is even more surprising given that only Turkish Airlines Swiss Lufthansa Air France and BA operate from and to Basel as proper international airlines and surely it cannot be that hard to learn their business class products. This has been happening for the last three - four months now. The airport facilities are extremely poor.

We took the bus and it dropped us beside it. The check-in area was basic but efficient. My tip to anyone is do not go though security until about an hour before your flight is due to leave as once you get though security there is nothing there. Only enough seats for around 50 people in the departure lounge. We stupidly thought that maybe there would be better food in the departure lounge. All there is is a small Illy cafe which cost us 12 euros for 2 bags of crisps and 2 cokes. I know airport prices are bad but that took the biscuit. The departure lounge is so small and there was around 600 people there with only seats for 50 of them. One other poster said this airport reminded him of a barn I'd agree with that.

Wrong there was a short queue for initial luggage scanning but we then joined a very slow queue (over 20 minutes) for secondary screening.

They simply don't work and I've had to use the desks as a result to get my boarding pass. The departures process is not too bad compared to other airports.

Added to that is the walking distance to some of the gates even younger passengers were out of breath. Why did BHX not install a moving walkway when building the International Pier. Same thing happened on return. Not connected to airbridge parked close to arrivals door but then long trek to passport control.

The girl on desk was very nice and patient and even told us to just move things from one case to other however the whole thing was bizarre because leaving Dublin there was no problem with luggage and going back the plane was only 1/3 full so a bag 2"" over limit was not really going to cause problems nor was any extra weight {which wasn't an issue anyway}.

bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,Morgan Dye,United Kingdom,2015-06-15,"I think there are two sides to Bordeaux airport: the main terminal and a budget airline terminal. The latter was really bad when I travelled through a few weeks ago. I think they must be in the process of upgrading it, or building it altogether! Presently its like a DIY airport made out of Ikea flatpack. When you check in you have to take your bags round to a separate desk for them to be tagged and sent to the plane. This created a pretty chaotic and busy environment. The queue for security was long and merged with the queues for the bag drop area. Once through security there were more queues that snake round the shopping section whilst people wait to go through immigration and the boarding areas for the flights. This means that its impossible to look round the retail area and food areas. It was all so chaotic and such a muddle! I'd hate to think what it'll be like once peak season kicks in. As i said, i think they're in the process of constructing this terminal, which is called the 'billi' terminal, as it had a very temporary feel to it. In the meantime, prepare yourself for lots and lots of chaotic queuing.

Not quite as bad as the inhuman misery of Marseilles- Provence but not far off it. Laughably it is called Billi - are we supposed to feel better about being treated like cattle if the shed has a stupid name? As you enter leave your dignity at the door you are now a piece of self-loading freight. They have not wasted money on seats information screens (there appeared to be one) staff computers and other luxuries. Surprisingly they have found the money for a 'duty free' shop (most prices seemed higher than in the supermarket). You will stand in queues with your luggage to show your boarding pass passport and of course a good 20 minutes at the 'gate' (ie a door). What really puzzles me is why they have done this; I have used the main terminal at Bordeaux several times with low cost airlines and found it perfectly adequate and not overstretched - why is 'Billi' necessary? I can only assume it is about putting people in their place and if you are a low- cost passenger that place is beneath contempt. If the people who design these horrible places read this have you ever tried using one of your terminals under normal circumstances? Probably not you are too busy enjoying the business class lounge. If you are responsible for managing one ditto and put someone who knows what they are doing in charge; also invest in some new technology - checking people by hand went out about 20 years ago at most airports.

The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports.

brasilia-airport,/airport-reviews/brasilia-airport,Brasilia Airport customer review,G Villela,NA,2009-04-08,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice.

The circular donut-shaped design with one wall between the central area and the boarding gates limited space so that if you had to walk between gates you needed to cut through lines of people waiting for every flights. The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada.

Are the staff culturally sensitive and ethical?

Making both arriving and departing passengers pass through the duty free stores thereby running the gauntlet of aggressive sales staff is totally unacceptable an insult to the travelling public and something of which Brisbane Airport Corporation should be ashamed. While I pass through the terminal at least twice a month and used to spend time perusing the shops while outbound I now refuse to spend a cent in the shops on principle. On top of that mornings at the airport (both arriving and departing) are an absolute debacle with long queues and insufficient customs staff and the most inefficient security staff (outbound) I have ever encountered. If the body scanners are in use it seems that the whole screening process for the rest of the passengers comes to a halt. To further inconvenience the travelling public the scanning machine operators change frequently and instead of adopting a system whereby there is a short overlap between operators they have to stop the whole system for about five minutes further backing up the queue. Finally when inbound and holding an express card one would think the process would be efficient right? No. Following the signs to the express queue at immigration results in the longest possible walk to the counters and then you simply merge with the normal queue! Who dreams up these systems? My recommendation is to avoid this airport wherever possible. Unfortunately for those who live in Brisbane there is little alternative but at least don't encourage their poor management lack of planning and foresight and the derision with which they treat passengers by spending money at the overpriced duty free stores or extortionate foreign exchange facilities.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Seems the international arrival area is going through extensive renovation to ensure each arriving passenger has to pass through duty free upon arrival. Upon arrival on Monday I could not believe my eyes when we actually had to stand in line in front of the duty free area for approx. 30 minutes before being able to enter the actual immigration area. Fortunately I had an express card and eventually made it to the baggage claim within 1 hour but believe economy passengers would have easily spent 2-3 hours clearing immigration. Air conditioning was not sufficient and saw lots of tired families arriving with their children after a long trip from Europe/Asia/America. Immigration experience simple and fast as usual but the incompetence did not stop there. Had the pleasure of waiting another 30 minutes for my luggage as some clever mind decided to combine our QF flight from LA (B 747) and a SQ flight from Singapore (A 330) and the same luggage belt. As the majority of passengers were stuck in the immigration line no luggage was removed from the belt so lots of luggage was backed-up and could not get on to the belt. Needless to say that 2 other belts were not used at all while others just serviced single flights on small B 737 aircraft.

My Qantas flight from Singapore was parked at the furthest gate from immigration. Once I reached immigration it was slow and there was a very long queue. Australians were given priority to clear immigration first. Departure was more pleasant than expected. I recently read about reviews claiming that the security screenings and immigration were very slow when I went to the airport it wasn't as slow as expected.

Flying business class on EK had checked-in online and with carry-on only went straight to security and immigration. No priority security lane open at 6am but at least 50-60 people in front of me many of them being apparent first time travellers as it took ages to get through. Finally made it to immigration only to be told that I had no right to line-up in the express line as I did not have the express card from the airline. Told staff that I had checked-in at home and showed my business class boarding card but no luck so off I went behind the previous 50-60 passengers and wasted another 30 minutes. Instead of being through security in the usual 10-15 minutes it took me nearly an hour which is precious time as I needed to get some work done in the lounge.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Morgan Dye,United Kingdom,2015-06-15,"I last travelled through Bristol airport around eight or nine years ago and I remember it being pretty decent for an airport of its size. This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future. If you're flying this summer though, prepare for some long and sweaty queuing at security.",Arrival and Departure,13-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,4,1,3,3,NA,3,1,0,NA,1

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,S Frith,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,I flew from this airport on Sunday 5th April 2015 to Reykjavik along with my mother on EasyJet flight EZY6001 our first time of flying with this firm and from this airport. After going to the baggage drop-off and having my suitcase weighed and labelled I mentioned that it was hand luggage and the member of staff said he did not know what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but it would be more than helpful if there were signs saying where passengers with just hand luggage have to go to check in rather than have them queue in the wrong place. It would also be helpful if there could be signs (or staff) telling people well in advance when they will need to show their passport / boarding cards and what needs to be placed in the trays for scanning rather than wait until passengers are at the scanners and therefore causing unnecessary delays. On the return journey (EZY6002 on 9 April 2015) we were rudely told to show the glossy photo to the scanner and stand on the footprints on the floor. My mother and I had no idea what the two female members of staff meant and eventually one of them took my passport and showed the photo to the scanner but once we stood on the footprints the two members of staff wandered off leaving us unsure what to do next - the picture on the machine was confusing. After several minutes the two staff members were altered to the fact that we were still standing on the footprints and returned to tell us we could go through the gate all of which could have been prevented if the staff had taken the time to explain the procedure and waited to check that we had understood rather than wander off for a gossip! Finally could all airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be a nervous first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2015-03-28,As a regular user I have often complained about the long walk to/from flights. The good news is that the new gates require a much shorter walk and there is far more seating than at the western apron. Note however that many flights do still go from the western gates so you may not be lucky. Early morning is always the busiest time but on my last visit the wait for security was about 5 minutes (though getting through took another 5 minutes as I kept setting the scanner off never found out why). Return was OK but could be better the usual lengthy wait for immigration checks but at least one of the officers took the time to explain why using the scanners is often no quicker than queuing for a manual check. There are still irritating things about Bristol (expensive car parks paying for trolleys limited seating in some areas) but it is in the mid range of UK airports from my experience.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable. Even Gatwick and LHR don't do that! Generally I like small airports because what you lose in facilities you gain in ease of use and lower cost. But not here.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

I sent an email to the airport politely asking why this happens as it seems inefficient on a number of levels and inconveniences passengers for no apparent reason. Two weeks have passed and no reply I assume there is no rational explanation. It also indicates the indifference with which the airport's management appear to regard their customers. For all this I am not entirely negative about the airport I have never encountered rude staff at security or border control as mentioned by others some appear rather bored and disinterested but to be honest it is not the most exciting job however they have always been polite.

Flights particularly from the western apron are called early. Arrivals were not so good but just acceptable the passport readers were working but very slow - at least once it would have been quicker to queue to see an officer. My main gripe is the misuse of resources my last arrival was typical: the aircraft was parked at the far end of the western apron giving us a 400+m walk to the terminal building (they do at least advertise the distance). As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used. Surely a more efficient use of space that would make customers' lives easier is a relatively easy thing for management to achieve? Also why do you have show your boarding pass to buy a newspaper?

My first gripe is the outrageous car parking charges. £38 for a long weekend in midwinter is a bit over the top. Secondly charging for a trolley is profiteering. Why doesn't the government do something about organisations ripping off captive customers. Thirdly in an attempt to lure passengers into buying something from the shops after going through security the owners have reduced to a minimum the area available to actually sit somewhere whilst waiting for your flight.

The duty free shop is oversized there is simply no logic to the flow of passengers and dependent upon the gate allocated to you you may or may not be waiting on the right floor. If you are unfortunate to be using gates 14/15 be prepared for a very long and uncomfortable walk without travelators or escalators to negotiate the long distances and multiple steps and stairs.

I also think they have increased the seating since my last visit there was plenty free. On arriving we were bussed to immigration but again no queue and I was driving out of the car park 20 minutes after landing. It was my best experience here for many years however there was still an absurdly early call to the gate - a 300 metre walk followed by 20 minutes standing staring at four grey walls. My flight left late morning when about 5 departures are scheduled in two hours and we arrived just ahead of the evening rush. It is clear that there are far fewer flights using Bristol this winter than in the summer or previous winters and at these traffic levels it copes well and is pleasant.

The concerns of previous reviewers about a severe lack of space are being borne out seating is fully occupied almost all of the time and there is very little space apart from the retail area. As the previous report said the walk to flights leaving from the western apron is lengthy; they allow for this by calling flights well before they are due to leave. OK if you are reasonably mobile but are there more seats when you get to your gate? Guess. So that is another 15 minutes of standing around. As before the queue for passport checks on arrival is laughably long most of the time (the new scanners were not working this week - though were on my previous visit).,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,S Kendall,United Kingdom,2010-06-06,The facilities were fair though snaking customs queues unnecessary. Duty Free shop offered goods found considerably cheaper on the high street. Boarding was reasonable although seating in the waiting area limited. Parking is highway robbery and taxis cost £42 return. I travelled again in May - an absolute nightmare. The snaking queues for customs were worse there was almost no available seating in the waiting areas - most space taken up by new cafes and retail shops. Then there was the walk to the aircraft! I am a pensioner with walking difficulties though not bad enough to warrant being disabled. Is it possible that untold millions have been spent to expand the airport and that they have not seen fit to provide escalators or moving walkways or lifts. If it had not been for the kindness of others who helped me up innumerable stairs and along the half-mile (confirmed by an official a half- mile!) walk to the boarding gate I don't know what I'd have done. From now on Heathrow will be a better option: a comfortable return journey by coach will only cost £25.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Last weekend was my first visit in 2010 and I have to agree that the amount of seating has reached the point where it is inadequate in all but the very quietest times. I do not know if the on-going expansion will address this problem but if not there will be major problems in the summer - the amount of physical space available even for standing has been reduced drastically. Where is one supposed to go if one does not want overpriced food and drink? There are still good things about Bristol: the long-stay car park is expensive but a two minute walk from the terminal building and on Saturday we checked-in went through departure control and security in about five minutes total (it was a quiet time of day). The management need to be aware that one of best UK airport experiences (in my opinion) is rapidly approaching average at best.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-charleroi-airport,Brussels Charleroi Airport customer review,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,2013-12-20,Relatively new and shining clean due to the generous use of stainless steel. Epitome for the low-cost airport of the XXI century: Extra long and narrow tarmac to avoid using buses or skyways. Where the similarly long and narrow building can't reach there are long covered walkways airside. Be prepared for possible long walks both on arriving and departing. This is an airport that depends on Ryanair so you can't expect any pity. Asking for a boarding pass (a minimalist slip of paper) for a checked in flight costs 70 euros no matter what. There are two ATM machines in the hall one near the arrivals one at the opposite corner of the building (on the left exiting from airside). Exiting at this same corner you can reach the bus station where you can buy a ticket for Charleroi South Station from the machines (coins notes cards accepted). The bus station is not covered and Charleroi is a very rainy place but lucky enough you get the bus from platform A which is the nearest to the terminal. On departing I was puzzled by the double way in at security apparently doing the same things but working alternatively. Security fast and professional. Duty free looks good but I had no time to spend. After stepping to the gates you are in no- man land: long minimalist bleaky corridors where the stainless steel only adds up to the coldness of the environment. There's a bakery stand before the last hop to the tarmac. In winter I suggest buying a hot drink. The low cost travel industry states that if passengers have to wait they have to do it as close as possible to the aircraft they are boarding and in this airport this means in the open air though under a covered walkway.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Charleroi is popular because the rock-bottom price discount airlines that fly to Brussels are based here rather than Brussels Zaventem. Be warned the security lines at Charleroi do take quite some time to clear around 30 minutes compared to perhaps half that time at Brussels Zaventem. Decent choice of food air side though pricey. Toilets were slightly cramped. Bus service to Charleroi-Sud train station will take you where you can catch a train to Brussels (takes about 1 hour by train).

Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet.

brussels-zaventem-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-zaventem-airport,Brussels Zaventem Airport customer review,M McManus,United Kingdom,2012-10-10,Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminals; terminal A serves flights within the Schengen zone terminal B serves those outside. Terminal B takes slightly longer to get through as there are passport inspections before you are allowed to pass through to security. Terminal A only needs you to swipe your boarding pass on a scanner but it is a surprisingly long walk from the entrance of Terminal A to the gates. Both terminals have a decent choice of cafes and restaurants although the best restaurants are before you go through security you'll find them on the food court on level 3. There is wifi but you need to buy a scratch card with a password to use it. There are yellow vending machines security side selling them. Be warned that the shuttle buses (number 12 and 21) don't take you to the city centre they go to the European institutions which are a couple of miles south east of the city centre. Shuttle bus journeys are €5 one way or ten journeys for €25 which makes a lot of sense if you use it a lot. If you want a cheap way to the centre the SNCB train on level minus 1 will take you to Gare Centrale for about €7. A taxi is around €40.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient.

We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn't know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow. Going through we reach the area to access departure gates. Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing.

Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores.

Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates.

Fortunately there are not too many staff hassling for your money. baggage reclaim was reasonably efficient. No real problems departing. Again there are very limited facilities. There are a couple of shops selling the usual tourist fare and expensive bottles of alcohol. The bar/café is not bad but is overpriced - $5 for a simple snack.

burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,/airport-reviews/burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,Burbank Glendale Pasadena Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-11-18,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus.

There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier.

You are often pestered by staff for a tip for even the most basic service. The selection of souvenirs was poor surprising given this is Egypt. The security arrangements seem illogical as you are screened by security twice just yards apart before check in.

Arrival was on time but many passengers as there were 2 planes from Saudi Arabia. Bags already waiting and out in no time. Taxis hunting for arrivals so a good idea to avoid them and take an official taxi to avoid rip off. NO Sky Priority for any Business class passengers. Departure was a breeze at check in. No priority fro C class passengers at passport control. Couple of nice shops and cafes. The C class lounge is quiet and nice with non-functional internet which managed to irk most guests. The holding boarding gate is too small to hold a full B777 so it caused great discomfort to passengers and the numerable carts and wheelchairs. Very claustrophobic. Bussing to and the terminal is OK.

cairo-airport,/airport-reviews/cairo-airport,Cairo Airport customer review,Farouk Mogheth,NA,2010-01-11,"My return flight from Cairo has left a bit of a sour taste. I think that ""tea money"" or bakshish was requested virtually on each step from check in till boarding which is something I haven't experienced yet in CAI airport before. It started when I flew from Munich to Cairo T3 where I had a 2 days stop over. Passport control was fast which is great after that and 2 meters from passport control a police officer re-checks your passport to see the entry stamp. You go to puck up your bags and there it starts. When you see your bag and go to get it then you find a couple of guys trying to help you forcefully and then expect tea money as they specifically said it. I go through the ""green zone"" which practically isn't that green as everyone is being controlled. Check passport again and open bags. close bags and ""welcome to Cairo any chance for tea money sir?"". The arrival hall is empty as all waiting people were kicked out for some reason or another. My departure for Bangkok was definitely an experience. I will count passport checks and tea money from my check in to boarding! TO enter the hall and the check in area then you have to be only a passenger - so I got my passport checked and the gentleman wished me a pleasant flight and some tea money. I go to Xrays to enter the check in area so I get my passport checked and the officer smiled and asked if I had any tea money. I go to check in that took longer than its supposed to. Each check in counter has a gentleman to help the bags on the scales. Since I had only a small bag I helped myself and my passport checked and tea money was asked by the helper. I proceed to Passport control and go through with ease. I proceed to the gate where the passport is checked and went again through x rays while boarding at the door the passports were checked again and I was once again asked for tea money. I was annoyed by that stage - going through he airbridge to the plane and what do we have there - a gentleman controlling my passport I mean security is a good thing but this is a bit weird. I would like to rest assured tourists will be spared much of the tea money (not a guarantee) since I am part Egyptian and look so.

The terminal building is airy and clean sufficient amount of shops and cafes walking distances are not that far. The access taxiways to the terminal takes ages so the planes taxing was around 25min! The negative points are more because of local habits. For the first time I met a female passport control officer who was rude for that I am taking 2 stars off. Only passengers can enter the terminal building even the waiting areas. If you are not a passenger then you have to ""buy"" a ticket which is a bit annoying as they sent us 600m away to a stall to get the ticket.

I love the fact that they have the friendly greeters in white Stetsons it certainly makes you feel you have arrived somewhere different also love the fact that they help people with mobility problems or young children by giving them a lift on the golf buggies from the airbridge to customs. This was brought into sharp contrast on arrival back at Manchester with the ludicrous up and down stairs long and winding walk you have to do on arrival. The customs guys were certainly abrupt but no more than I had experienced in other parts of Canada - in fact they only asked us 2 quick questions before letting us through - other groups of passengers seemed to get far more of a grilling. Baggage reclaim was really fast signage to rental cars was easy to follow and I'd say we were completely out of the airport within 1hr of landing which is not bad at all. Flying out was positive too - had heard rumours that the security staff could be quite rude but if anything they were a bit too friendly.

On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal.

cape-town-airport,/airport-reviews/cape-town-airport,Cape Town Airport customer review,M Preston,NA,2008-10-03,45 minutes to wait for luggage when only one international flight had landed is simply unacceptable or to quote the word which was one of the options on the SMS questionnaire that passengers can complete pathetic. Also the luggage was delivered to a different carousel to the one shown on the boards. The aircraft I arrived on (EK) was parked away from the terminal and we were bussed to the terminal. The driver did not bother to park close to the steps and passengers had to walk through puddles of rainwater. The airport has good facilities is extremely clean and immigration was reasonably fast. Large areas are still under construction and I prefer not to think what might happen with the 2010 football matches.

caracas-airport,/airport-reviews/caracas-airport,Caracas Airport customer review,A Hetier,NA,2008-11-05,One needs more than arriving 2 hours before take-off time for international flights. I would suggest 3. Queues are terrible everywhere (check-in taxes immigration). And why taxes can't be paid by card?! On arrival migration services seem more efficient (search me...) and luggage is delivered efficiently. It is a pity not to be able to get money from an ATM in the international space (only local cards seem to work). On departure when you pass migration you get into a renewed part of the airport with plenty of space totally different from the departure area which is crowed. Duty free shops are nice as well as the food offer. Some don't like the patterns on the floor of the departure area but it's one of the charms of Maiquetía airport.

cardiff-airport,/airport-reviews/cardiff-airport,Cardiff Airport customer review,Andrew Graham,United Kingdom,2013-08-07,Dull ugly and (worst of all) the most unreliable and infrequent airport-to-city centre transport system of any airport I have known. Little wonder the airport is a white elephant recently bailed out by the Welsh Assembly government. You will arrive and discover that there are no taxis (these must be ordered) no trains (although there is a train link some distance away requiring a taxi!) and (most shameful of all) buses that depart once every 45 minutes! The latter are poorly signed and the whole this is a fiasco. I arrived on a flight at Cardiff Airport at 7.30pm and the terminal was closed. We were escorted through an area by airport staff to an exit and dumped outside to fend for ourselves (see above about lack of transportation). It was like flying to Uzbekistan circa 1953!

The delay was at passport control as three flights arrived within about 20 minutes of each other. By the time the girls came through the queue for car parking payment at one end of the arrivals area virtually joined the queue at the other end for the (one?) ticket validating machine.

A few packet of crisps and a tall glass fridge with three bottles of water and a handful of bottles of orange juice. That isn't what people pay VIP fees for.

The building itself is where the positives end. The facility is hopelessly inadequate. There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay. If you are arriving be in no hurry to get to the baggage carousel; you will stare at it for what seems like an eternity before it starts to move and even then the delivery of luggage will be erratic.

Went to go through passport control - closed for 10 minutes (make that 30 but 10 minutes is Sicilian for a delay of indeterminate length) the reason being the departure lounge is only big enough for the passengers of one aircraft so they only let that many through passport control at once.

Now departures is an entirely different matter you have to go through two security checks pay the departure tax which I think is pretty disgusting especially since they have increased it from PHP550 to PHP750 and the Cathay Pacific Lounge is pretty awful with extremely limited food and drinks and very dated. The duty free shops is expensive there is only one souvenir shop with some sort of food (admittedly I have never eaten there) a small smoking bar the washroom facilities are pretty basic too.

We arrived quite late from HKG and had to wait quite a while for immigration to process our full flight together with a PAL flight from Japan. Luggage claim area was like stepping back in time....a bit dodgy but ok. Leave the terminal and you are literally bombarded left and right by taxi drivers and money exchangers. Leaving was a different story. The check-in desks for the international departures are behind doors that are kept locked until a few hours before departure which means you are sitting in a rather dingy terminal until your airline is ready to check you in. Security is a joke but that didn't surprise us after being in the Philippines. Once you check in you have the option of going through to the gate or back into the main terminal. We were told to go to immigration and were surprised with the fact that we had to pay an airport tax P 550 or $ 11. Once through passport control you are at the gates. There is ONE store: Phlilippes Duty Free (total rip- off and joke) and two cafeterias which were asking ridiculous amounts for everything on the menu. As the gate area was kept closed you wait in a huge area behind passport control just behind passport control. We had a laugh as we stood (there were only 5 chairs) behind the passport control people who were playing video games on their computers. That explains why they snarled at us when we arrived! We interrupted them!!!! Other than stand and wait you can be massaged by ladies that await you when you clear immigration who bother you even when you barely look in their direction.

Check-In pretty good and Passport Control and Security all pretty smooth. No requirement to remove belts or laptops for security scanning but do enforce the 100ml liquid rules from Europe. In the International Departures no dining opportunities but a couple of coffee-shop options along with the usual array of Duty Free shops. Most departures are from one of the 11 airbridges.

Flew into Chengdu from Shenzhen where it was quite a lengthy walk from the Terminal 2 gate to baggage claim. This was topped off with a further lengthy walk to the opposite end of the terminal for the taxi rank. Flying out a week later I had time to look at the airport more closely. Terminal 1 is old and definitely looking it's age. Terminal 2 was shiny and modern with three fingers that extend out. Plenty of interesting shops to keep myself amused inside the terminal and the lounges were adequately comfortable.

Surprised to see that despite having world class airports so close (Bangalore and Hyderabad - I visited both and they are excellent) Chennai didn't learn any lessons. Both the International and Domestic terminals are messy. Not clean and I am sure many wouldn't like to use the rest rooms. There are not too many options in the terminal for restaurants or bars or shopping.

Construction dirt and grime are seen on all white-painted columns and girders. The lounge is located on a higher floor and is accessible only by lift. An escalator would have moved people more conveniently. Anyway the lounge is pathetic compared to the lounges in the old terminal. There is no arrival immigration in the new terminal and passengers are forced to walk some 500 m to the immigration counters in the old terminal. The smelly toilets seem to have been transplanted from the old terminal and are maintained just as filthy.

However once inside this ""new"" terminal is already looking old with dirty carpets and glass windows. The worst part was that this new terminal is just a facade. One goes down the escalator to the boarding gates and finds oneself back in the old terminal once again. This so- called gateway to South India needs a new airport privately built and managed.

Couple of coffee shops outside which is welcome if you have friends / relatives seeing you off. Inside there are multiple options now in terms of coffee shops restaurants (couple of them are due to open) book -shops and other small shops. Ample seating space and the quality of announcements is also very clear. The washrooms have received a lot of bad press since the terminal opened but that seems to be improving now. Not everything can be blamed on bad maintenance here some of it is also dependent on user behavior. Also noticed that there was no regular cleaning of the trash bins and most of them were on the verge of over flowing. Something needs to be done about this. The arrival side has an easy access to the car park with a luggage ramp which is quite helpful. Only minus point is the long walk from the gates to the baggage claim area.

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Narayan,NA,2008-09-24,"Arrivals has continuously improved in the past 4 years. Passport control quick. Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out. You could easily miss the call - but they track you down anyway if they know you checked-in.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

In comparison I agree that it is one of the better airports in India particularly the international building. It is reasonably spacious given the passenger numbers and never as chaotic as for instance Delhi. The airline lounges are definitely better in Madras than elsewhere in India. What is frustrating is the basic ""Indian"" layout of having the departure gates separated from the airbridges by a common corridor also used for arrivals so you often find your boarding procedure interrupted by inbound passengers flowing past the door of your boarding gate.

Would not be the best airport in the world but certainly better than ORD as well as many other U.S. airports. Cannot say much about check-in times as check-in at the counter mostly avoided due to web check-in but the security checkpoint sometimes could form quite a bit of queue. However the lines are processed relatively fast so no need to be totally terrified at the scene. Airside seems to be better than landside. The concourses are actually quite spacious with lots of eateries and other shops. The concourses and the restrooms fairly clean and well maintained. No free wifi but at least power outlets are abundant. Ground transportation also fair. The orange line connects MDW with downtown so at least a reliable option is there for those wanting to visit downtown. However no direct links from the interstate to MDW.

chicago-midway-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-midway-airport,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,Erez Har-Tal,NA,2003-04-02,Just returned from a trip MDW-PHX-MDW. Wow what a change from old Midway. Chicago Midway new terminal does not even resemble the old crowded Midway airport. A lot of room around the check-in counters and in the departure hall. A large corridor that connects the departure hall with the gates area. This corridor serves as a security check-point waiting line. Very large and roomy and can accomodate easily everyone. Departed during the peak hours of 7-9 am. Large food court and decent shoping option. The new gates area is roomy with plenty of seating space. If you are unlucky to use the old gates though (Southwest still uses some of the old gates) the same old very dense area with very tired look and feel. But these are phased out gradually. When returned docked at a remote gate and had to walk quite a bit to connect to the new terminal arrival hall. Once in the arrival hall luggage carousels are quite big and not too crowded. There are security personnel that make sure before you leave that you picked the baggage that belongs to you and not someone's else. Good connection to the loop via train only $1.50. Midway is a decent less crowded alternative to O'Hare. Wish more major carriers will start serving it more often.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,William Gustin,United States,2015-07-18,"I understand O'Hare is remarkably busy and has the weather to contend with so I do extend some grace for the reality induced by the moderately rainy day of my travel. However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare.

Once through any domestic security checkpoint you can access all domestic terminals (1-3). There is a wide variety of places to eat and drink or grab something quick at a broad range of prices. While not a shopping mall like many newer airports there are plenty of places to shop and browse. The Blue line train is an inexpensive and reliable way to get to or from downtown Chicago or its neighborhoods. I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time. The main complaint I hear is from non-US citizens arriving at the International Terminal (Terminal 5) waiting in very long lines.

This seems to be where the old food court used to be all the food courts that were on the upper level at T5 are now airside and the prices seem to be a little lower than last year. T5 is the best of all the terminals at O'Hare since it is smaller then the others so there is less walking time to get around it the car parks are just outside and Coach USA are outside every hour they offer good value travel (go their web site to see where they go) the train to other terminals comes around every 10 minutes and takes a few minutes to get to T2 the roads around the airport can be confusing but that can be said about most airports.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs. There was not a hint of courtesy politeness or helpfulness in any of the staff. US citizens seemed to be getting through in about 15 minutes.

When leaving check-in desks are plenty and gates are only (on average) a 2 minutes walk from security gates (which are next to the check-in desks). Be aware that T5 has no eateries and only very basic duty free. Almost nothing in fact. But as said before T5 is meant to be an arrivals/departure building which works very well and not a shopping mall.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,J Olivier,NA,2009-03-04,Arrived from Paris at O'Hare and everything went downhill from there. We had allowed 2 hours to connect to our flight to Calgary Canada. The plane was 30 minutes late from Paris and the immigration line is terrible. It takes forever to go through. Canadians do not require fingerprinting and photos yet we have to stand in the same line. The US residents cleared quickly but it took us 50 minutes. After that we grabbed our bags which were sitting on a non-revolving luggage carousel since we took so long and attempted to drop off our bags. All there was was United personnel yelling at people to move around to different spots and there was no queue. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to drop the bags off. Took the airport train to terminal 1. Not well thought out everything revolves around 1 escalator so people bunch up. Went through the United Priority security. Not sure why it was priority it took 20 minutes for TSA to scan 10 people. I'm sorry but it shouldn't take that long. We then had to do the run between terminal B and C. When we arrived at the gates the jetway was pulling away from the plane fortunately they put it back so we could get on. 2 hours should be sufficient. When we got to Calgary our bags and the bags of about 15 other passengers were missing. Apparently ours got hung up in TSA which doesn't have screening for transferred bags at the international terminal so they went off sight and then come back. Unfortunately ours never returned. Now we have to hope they are on the next plane and clear Canadian customs ok.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,NA,2005-06-28,I'd suggest avoiding O'Hare if you are trying to connect from an international flight to a domestic one. No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chongqing-jiangbei-airport,/airport-reviews/chongqing-jiangbei-airport,Chongqing Jiangbei Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal; Singapore Wellington and thousands of others including the old Christchurch airport the same. What genius designed this in Christchurch? The regional terminal is a zoo with grossly inadequate facilities - especially seating - to service the volume of passengers. The old airport used to be pretty good - perhaps a bit of a mess in terms of design but it had a lot of character and history behind it. The new(ish) International Lounge area is also good with lots of glass and natural light and good passenger facilities.

One small baggage area with an exit for domestic travellers no customs check required and one exit for international travellers with a through customs check result in chaos. The lack of baggage carts and hundreds of people struggling with several large suitcases each all struggling towards the one international exit result in a rugby scrum.

However they do serve Red Bull - go figure. They charge Rs 240 (around US$ 6) for a cheese sandwich - outrageous in a country such as India. Duty Free Shop prices are in US$ but no flights depart from here to US. If you elect to pay in a currency of any destination country (e.g. UAE Dirhams) they will overcharge you on the exchange rate and then again by not having small change. Total premium: 15%.

colombo-airport,/airport-reviews/colombo-airport,Colombo Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2012-10-03,The last time I came through Columbo Airport I gave it a pretty good review sadly things seem to have deteriorated - either that or the airport is struggling to keep up with increased passenger traffic. Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

This in turn leads to the first floor of an expanded main terminal in which arriving / departing passengers mix freely. There were several immigration desks open even though it was 3.30am and I was processed quickly and efficiently. Baggage reclaim took a long time - bags were added to the carousel painfully slowly and it took about 45 minutes to recover my two suitcases. Once through customs there were several currency exchanges - don't bother comparing rates they're all the same! Departure on the 14th â€“ nothing much has changed since I was last here. The drop off zone is small and chaotic with passengers having to (try to) queue up outside to get through the limited number of security / baggage screening lanes immediately inside. Once through security and into the terminal things are a lot more efficient although CMB remains one of those peculiar airports where the check in area is partitioned off from the rest of the departures hall and passengers are not allowed to proceed until the check in desks for their flights open. Fortunately there was sufficient seating while I waited. Once checked in and through emigration the airside section was spacious and comfortable if somewhat eccentrically laid out.

Instead they must drop you off about 500 metres ahead of the terminal where you are transferred to a rickety bus without A/C. How this is supposed to improve security (the officially stated reason) is beyond me - but it does provide additional income for touts who pounce on passenger's luggage and lift it into the buses.

No one minds waiting to get through security as it is obviously essential to safe travel but in T3 it was like a massive rugby scrum and surely the antithesis of security! It started off well enough with a pleasant security officer guiding people into a queue but the queue then approached two information girls who directed people to left or right. On each side there were 6 or so belts but no system of queuing so that everyone was just piling towards the conveyor and security gate in a random fashion pushing and shoving trying to get to the gate. It was actually very unsafe and we were left like this for about 20 minutes whilst trying to get to the security gate.

In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable.

If you are in need of refreshment as we were there is no cafe just a long queue to a buffet counter where you are ripped off! We had to pay over 15 Euro for two small lukewarm barely drinkable coffees a miniscule tooth breaking baguette and a soft drink. This was virtually thrown at us by two disinterested girls who probably would not understand the meaning of common courtesy or customer satisfaction. Only a couple of the monitors mounted from the ceiling were working - others broken or switched off and nothing like enough of the hard metal seats to accommodate the crowd of people who were waiting for flights when we were there. Toilet facilities are very poor which I would not like to elaborate on! I pity anyone who has to spend any length of time in this confined area.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Fine to take sandwiches etc just not drinks - so had to pay 5 lira for a 500 ml bottle of water. Noticed this time that there is even less seating than there was at the beginning of the season which means that if you want a seat you have to sit in the food court areas.

The terminals themselves are very nice and modern. Security screening involved lengthy lines although passengers in wheelchairs get priority. Unfortunately all the food outlets are airside so it is necessary to go through security screening before getting something to eat or if you are exiting the terminal you must get your food before you leave the airside area and take it out with you. Unlike airports in Asia there are no smoking kiosks near the gates; the smoking areas are outside the terminals. Immigration is in a huge room which was very crowded when I entered. There was a customs officer pre-screening passengers entering the immigration section. Customs itself was smooth and non-eventful.

darwin-airport,/airport-reviews/darwin-airport,Darwin Airport customer review,P Taylor,NA,2008-02-28,If you want slow immigration clearances and unfriendly staff on arrival Darwin is your port of choice. Most flights arrive into Darwin in the early hours of the morning. Staff is always short. And everyone is given the third degree and queuing is not segregated. So if your an Australian behind a family of 5 overseas visitors expect to sit waiting for them while visas travel arrangements and passports are examined in every minute detail even though most residents arriving are a quick once over. I choose to fly into any other airport in Australia if returning from international destinations. The last flight I returned from overseas was a Tiger flight from Singapore. It was full and 90min late. Approximately 30% of the flight were late for a connecting Melbourne flight which was awaiting them. All these 30% were poorly directed to just 1 immigration staff while 1 experienced and 2 trainees looked after the rest of the flight. Most of the transit customers lined up in the normal queue and were returned to the back of the transit queue once they reached the front as there were only a few staff giving verbal directions to arriving customers. In addition the International arrival and departure areas are small. Its not uncommon for arriving queues to snake back through the airbridges.

I have read reviews here where people have criticized this airport for being too strict but this is for good measure and I think it cannot be ridiculed for it.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,D Gill,Canada,2014-01-25,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that.

It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later. Finally FX facilities need to be provided in the departure area after immigration so people have the possibility of converting unused Rupees into an alternative currency since it is not possible to exchange those in one's home country and it would appear taking Rupees out of India is actually illegal!,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one. Arriving from Australia was a dreadful experience because many flights arrive at the same time. There is no fast track.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-03-10,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals).

Even if you stay at a 5* hotel you might have difficulty in locating your driver. Traffic leaving the airport was bad but that was part of the Bali experience – chaotic order. Leaving the airport was a bit easier. Took a midday flight and it wasn't the peak period at DPS. Before proceed to the check in area we were asked to show our ticket. I was bit amused since nowadays who would have a paper ticket? Luckily they just wanted to confirm that I was actually a passenger so my iphone calendar with flight number confirmed that. Luggage drop was easy no queue and was handled by a very friendly lady. The departure hall was larger than I expected with a lot of shops.

TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags.

Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned.

The terminal itself is clean and un-crowded but once we got our bags we had to take them up one level then cross a pedestrian bridge over the airport road then down to a lower level go outside and find the appropriate shuttle bus. Rental car facilities are some distance from either terminal. You have to go to the lower parking structure level of either terminal and then take a rather long convoluted trip to the facility.

E.g. there is now a decent barista coffee shop and a few new duty free shops (although a number of them sell nothing except chocolate and cosmetics - no alcohol) in the departure lounge. However overall the Dhaka airport still ranks as one of the worst anywhere in the world. It is extremely dirty bathroom facilities are disgusting staff are rude and generally unhelpful immigration is a joke (locals are allowed to queue anywhere including in the lanes marked Foreign Passport and VIP only) check-in is terrible again people can que anywhere (business or economy).

All government institutions have an absolute aversion to any sort of change. There are a few less mosquitoes in the baggage claim area that is the only positive thing I can say. Immigration on arrival means long and slow moving queues. The Ruposhi Bangla business lounge is poor with limited seating and similarly limited range of snacks and drinks.

We were early for our Qatar Airways check in so did not experience any queues. Once through Immigration (very quick no waiting) there is free internet (4 terminals 30 minutes limit) and up the stairs there's a small cafe with reasonably priced (by airport standards) food (limited range Bangladeshi food only) if you don't mind the sales pitch to buy local confections!

The colour system they have for various passengers is great (yellow tags and cards for transfers Orange for quick transfers etc.). The terminal itself is just a glass box (I expected a larger venue) but functioned well. Clean with a couple of shops here and there but I believe the new airport is to open soon and would reflect Qatar's ambition to offer a world class airport. This one works but lets say it lacks any lustre for me its a non issue as long as all worked fine. The internet is free and appreciated even though works only on one side of the terminal and closer to gate 20 21 22 the signal is barely there and connection almost impossible. Staff are polite especially in the x-ray checks (which is a big issue for me especially in other Middle eastern airports). The only negative point is the people jammed downstairs when boarding the bus. For 2 flights the passengers were lead down but the bus wasn't there yet and it was very uncomfortable having a small room packed with people kids and screaming toddlers.

The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats. Sleep is impossible because of the crowds. 3) Perhaps overwhelmed by it all staff are generally friendly but unhelpful or surly and unhelpful. For far fewer flights this would be a decently modern little airport. However when crammed in with the rest of the cattle it feels like a terrible place to be. When compared to the hub airports of the other 5 star airlines on skytrax (Singapore Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur - all of which I visited in the last year) it is a joke.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The new colour-coded transfer card system works well and clearing security only takes a few minutes even when several wide-body aircraft arrive at the same time. Staff are friendly and helpful with no hassle at security. Toilets rarely stay clean for long – the cleaners work very hard but they simply can't cope with the huge volume of pax. Shops are still cheap compared to other airports especially for bottled water. The biggest issue is probably the bus ride to/from the aircraft – this must surely now be the world's longest aircraft-to-terminal bus ride – the distances are huge!

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2012-10-09,The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough.

Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge.

For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare.

Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late).

I've been through Dubai airport literally a hundred times over the last seven years and never had any long queues at immigration and never seen a sub-bar bathroom. Pretty good bars and restaurants - far superior to most ""Western"" airports and enjoyed astounding Business lounges when someone else was paying. Have always been impressed by the spacious public areas. Compared to the tacky dirtiness and suffocating spaces in airports like JFK or Heathrow. I hear Terminal 2 is not as good as 1 and 3 so it might be that.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,K Cornelius,Netherlands,2014-11-05,Arrived on A380 from Amsterdam over 2 hours late because of on the one hand late departure from AMS and on the other hand being put in a holding pattern for an hour. That would have left still one hour for my transit to Bangkok but I hadn't counted on being parked 25 minutes by bus away from the terminal building. Imagine 500 people to be bussed to the terminal. Even though I was in the second bus out by the time I passed security and could start looking for my connecting flight the gate was closed. Queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed transit desk followed. So I spend the next nearly 7 hours in the airport lounges - my 'new' flight departed one hour late too due to - as was announced by the Captain - the backlog of flights resulting from that night's problems. By the way: signage could do with an improvement as well.

Bland costly food crowded toilets terrible showers with no place to put your clothes and bags except on the wet floor no charging points for devices except on the walls away from seats or in Starbucks and Costas (under one of the seats).

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,T Whittington,Netherlands,2013-12-31,I don't like Dubai Airport too much. During a stop-over you are trying to kill time perhaps score a bite in one of the overcrowded food places. Often these places are full with litter as the staff cannot keep pace with the plethora of visitors. In general too few places to sit kill time and even for airport standards over priced. And besides shopping for ostentatious items there's very little quality in terms of entertainment to be found at that airport. But it gets even worse when you enter Dubai.

In recent years it has got better. Queues are shorter for transit security for example. However you step off the plane and know you are going on a mystery tour. Up and sown endless escalators utterly confusing signs and massive overcrowding. Getting off the plane we were faced with signs to transit going in two totally opposite directions more than once. One of them led us into a blank corridor. The trains from one part of the terminal A to B or C or the reverse are very efficient. But until you get to the train you have no idea which bit you are in! Perhaps because of the confused layout there are a lot of staff available to help if you are stuck which is good.

Had hoped to check out the Duty Free for our return trip from London but the turnaround time was spent in a queue on another trip through security. Why is there not a transit lounge for short re-fuelling turnarounds? A transit lounge with toilets and coffee would be the sensible thing in the middle of the gruelling London/Australia trip. We also found the security/check in staff intimidating superior and the use of a lot of hand-waving and curt gestures didn't sit well. The terminal was very clean but it took ages lugging all our flight luggage to find a toilet.

Thankfully did online check in however still had to queue for luggage drop off which wasn't very long the line to enter passport control was endless but used e-gate. Had some time to spend in the massive duty free and to have breakfast it feels like a massive shopping mall at the busiest hour of the weekend clean spotless toilets though busy. On the way back was hassle free 4 minutes from the plane touching down until the door was open aircraft parked at the new concourse A which is dedicated to Emirates A380 planes. Had to take the underground train to passport control and after another 4 minutes I was at the belt waiting for my luggage which took a bit of time. Massive clean arrivals hall nice decent duty free and money exchange facilities the only concern is the taxi lines specially at night it was endless long queue.

This problem pales into insignificance though when compared with the biggest issue: the utter inadequacy of the bathrooms in the concourse area. I've seen lines of 15-20 men waiting outside the bathroom with another 10 inside. If on a short layover at DXB go straight to the gate and there is likely to be a much quieter bathroom there. Of course this is no help to people on 4hr+ layovers who have to wait until the gate opens.

We were told we could try for a flight to Cardiff but would need to go back to the booking hall - about a Kilometre away. I got back to the booking hall and bought a flight to Bristol on Ryanair. The flight was in 40 minutes so it would be a rush to get to the plane on time. I tried security but it was solid with passengers so I asked the staff on duty if I could get to the front but they were having none of it. I stood in the queue for security for 25 minutes and then ran to the gate to find the flight had shut up 10 minutes before it was due to take off. I went back to the booking hall and changed my ticket for the later flight which cost me another 110 euros.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Check-in and security screening lines are quite long. Dublin Airport Authority charges 1-2 euro for a plastic bag for liquids and if you do not have the coins you have to try to find change. Long walks to many gates and shopping is very poorly laid out just after security gates in T1. If you are looking for your VAT refund you have to make your way to Terminal 2 after security which will take 30 - 60 minutes round trip providing there are no line ups at the VAT desk. When arriving in Dublin Terminal 1 security is usually quite good but a fairly long walk from the gates.

Otherwise I mostly like Dublin Airport; walking distances seem no longer than most places. Check in can be very crowded but security and most sections of the airport are roomy and convenient.

The airport is very badly connected which is a huge failing and is totally unacceptable. No direct metro or train and so is very inconvenient. Reasonable sort of distance from the city so that is ok. Parking is hideously expensive and so are taxis so that is not good. As you have no other choice of airport you screwed so buckle up and get on with it.. The place is a building site at the moment with new terminals springing up on top of old ones. Check in Hall is old and tired but works except at peak times when it is bedlam. Security is actually good pleasant and efficient - so top marks on that score. The airside is chaos - the ""mall"" just inside security is diminutive narrow and very lacklustre frankly bad. there are too many useless over priced retail outlets and not enough food options. If you travel from pier B it is close but the arrangements they have for US flights are cattle like. Do not go down until you absolutely have to. Pier C is fine though with insufficient seating. Pier A is quite distant and really dreadful in terms of facilities of any sort. Pier D is somewhere in France and is disappointing when you get there after such a long walk. Arrivals off the plane. Bad at the outset because except from Pier B you have miles to walk and in Pier D's case a couple of counties.

The bus service to the city is cheap and convenient but be aware it runs according to the flight schedules rather than a regular timetable so you need to check the day before your departure.

On arrival two weeks ago check in took over 45 minutes and there was only 36 people in the queue. There were two staff at the desk but one spent most of the time on the phone. After this we went upstairs to security which is a joke. Only two lanes open with hundreds of people waiting in line. Staff are off hand and rude. New security halls are coming into service which is great but why is there a need to provide such bad service at the old ones? Security needs to be done properly however surely more lanes can be kept open to get the passengers through. We arrived at the airport more than two hours before the flight and only just got on the plane with no breakfast and having spent not a penny in the fancy shops because there was no time left. Returning was no better. The plane disembarked onto the concrete and we were left standing outside the building in the rain for 15 minutes because immigration didn't seem to have its act together and we therefore were not allowed inside the building.

Had checked in online and had only hand baggage. Went directly to security where we were forced to wait outside closed doors for five minutes. Edinburgh is transitioning to a new security hall. The passengers who have already been through security in the new hall have to cross at right angles the passengers who have yet to go through security in the old hall. Their solution is to close the doors to the old hall let the ""new hall"" passengers cross then close the doors to the new hall and let passengers pile into the old hall. We were told not to go to the new hall but wait there for the old hall. So we waited. On entry we found an enormous queue of passengers and only two security lanes (plus fast track) in operation. This was rush hour at Edinburgh airport. There was no calling of passengers forward for flights that were already boarding it was a case of hurry-up-and-wait (and no information). The passengers were shirty the security staff were harassed and rude. Bottom line - despite being an hour early for my flight and only needing to get through security I missed my plane. I wasn't the only one - three of us converged on the boarding gate at the same time. The only alternative flight was towards the end of the afternoon so my trip was cancelled. Edinburgh security used to be a dream (10-15 mins even during rush hour). Now it's a nightmare. There's no information on the website to let you know to be very early for your flight.

My real disagreement is with transport links there is a bus to the city centre every 10-15 minutes which costs £3 and when I used it took less than 20 minutes which seems as good as any other airport I know of in Britain. Obviously it will take longer when the traffic is busy however there is much publicity about a tram to link the airport and city to be opened in a couple of years so it is not really fair to say the problem is not being addressed (albeit rather late).,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Yes it is clean, new and modern but these were the only good things about it. There were at least 12 flights within the space of an hour and then nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours, the result, total chaos! I think there were literally 5 or so security lanes serving what would have been probably 2,500 passengers in an hour. We got to the airport about 2 and a half hours before departure and queued for almost 2 hours to get through security! Some people were panicking and trying to jump the queue as their flights were being called, but rightly so the passengers near the front stopped them. It's the only time I've ever had to run for a flight in my life. Turned out they were still missing over 50 passengers on the flight as they were still stuck in the terminal. Consequently Thomas Cook had to delay the flight. The airport shouldn't allow so many flights to go at once if it's totally incapable of handling them all.

Most of Bristol's holiday flights return in the early hours and after a long tiring day it is no joke having a 2 hour drive home from the airport. EasyJet have no plans to fly from Exeter as they say that their SW flights are OK from Bristol unfortunately they are the biggest middle of the night culprits.

We arrived 2.5 hours before our flight time and spent the next 2 hours queuing to get through to the departure gate. Checking our bags onto the flight was relatively quick and straightforward however once through this stage we had to join the queue to pass through security. We had to go back through the bag check in desk and join the end of the queue which by now stretched to the far end of the airport. Did not appear to be any rational process or system in place to try and move travellers efficiently through this aspect of your journey. This was causing distress to many who feared they would miss their flight. We eventually made it through this stage to the duty free area only to discover that any chance of visiting the shops was not an option as the you had to join another lengthy queue stretching the full span of the terminal to get through passport control and onto your departure gate. Not acceptable and quite frankly shambolic. Our holiday in Portugal was very good however this was a frustrating exasperating and disappointing end to the holiday and not a pleasant experience for anyone unfortunate enough to be passing through Faro today.

Given that it is really hard to understand what they were thinking when they designed this airport. There are 3 predominant types of users: people with families going on vacation people who speak little or no English and the elderly. Given that fact one marvels at how disorienting poorly organized and poorly signed this airport is. Terminal 1 has high volume cattle car carriers Southwest and JetBlue and there is hardly enough space for the lines at the ticket counters the lines at security and the lines at the small eating places. TSA seems to have been trained to stop terrorism by confusing and confounding passengers. There were different rules about what to take off or take out as you're going through the machines in different lines and each line had someone shouting conflicting commands. In one you left your shoes on before going through one machine then took them off. The rental car center seems well organized. But finding it unless you arrived at Terminal 1 requires GPS and a 10-minute briefing upon arrival. One can wander the big parking garage for what seems to be an eternity. Best example of how this airport works is how one gets to the garage from the rental counter.: There are two pair of doors. You can see the parking garage which is outside of the building through the glass in the doors. One pair has the word ""Enter"" written in bold the other has ""Exit."" Above the door that reads ""Enter"" is a bright emergency sign that reads ""Exit."" Since they both have automatic operators you can only use one. This must provide FFL staff hours of amusement watching septegenarians try to figure out which door won't knock them over. I want to meet the person who thinks this stuff up and smack some sense into him (or her).

This airport has one big advantage: once you have trekked yourself to the exit its a very fast (10-15mins) but expensive (5 Euros) S-Bahn ride to centre of town where tasty German sausages and beer awaits! I had a 3 hour stopover and this is what I did. It's a bit confusing because there is basically nothing to tell you when you've left the secure area (no customs or passport control visible) but I quite like that - reminds me I'm back in Europe! On the way back into the airport for my flight (about 11pm one of the last flights and I cut it pretty tight) I had no problems going through security - the Germans were as always full of beans and extra friendly! In Munich Lufthansa have free coffee machines at their gates but not here it seemed so that was a shame but overall a good experience based on the ease of getting to the city for food and beers. I think that if I had to kill time in the airport proper that I would quickly get bored however besides walking up and down there's not a lot else to do from what I saw.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

FRA is very user unfriendly if you are transferring most of T1 is outdated has the 70s feeling to it and gets extremely crowded in the security areas where long walks/rides are required flying in from London 1.5 hrs transfer time to another Schengen destination (Ljubljana) was barely enough with no time left to browse which is a shame as the airport claims to be a transfer wonder.

I am not sure that this is because it is big terminal it may just be that it is not logically laid out. As many have complained. The queues or security can be incredibly long and the staff seem to work very slowly.

Connection times for each leg where 1hr 40mins and 1hr 35 mins respectively. Read the reviews on this site about FRA and was very concerned I made a big mistake and not left enough time to make the transfers due to the confusing nature of airport. Having now made the trip I can wholly recommend the airport. On the outbound journey we parked at a bus stand and was bussed to B terminal. Our connecting flight departed from a C gate. The signage at the airport is clear. Follow the signs to C. The return journey was just as straightforward. We arrived at a C gate and had to transfer to B22. However this gate was changed to B47 during the time we were at the airport. But there was at least two clear announcements and flashing indications of change on departure gate boards. I agree the walks can take 15 mins or so but it is a big airport. What do people expect? Walk off one plane straight onto another? In conclusion if anybody is like me and is a rare user of FRA do not be put off by the negative comments on this site. There are plenty of signs and they are clear.

And my experience has been confined to Terminal 1. On a recent trip it took two hours to go from Gate C13 to Gate A40. There was just one official checking passports at the immigration gate for entering the Schengen zone so loads of passengers were pushing in with varying degrees of politeness because of their earlier flights. On the other hand transferring from Gate A34 to B23 was very smooth with the moving walkway in the connecting tunnel being fully functional and hardly anyone at the passport control. However after passing through passport control so quickly I had to waste time checking the departure gate for my flight. The departure gate for my flight to Osaka was posted on the monitors at Gate A34 but not on the monitors just outside the passport control. So I was wondering if there had been a gate change. Finally boarding the flight by row numbers proved chaotic though this might have been due to Lufthansa. Transferring via Frankfurt is like being an out-patient in a very poor ill- equipped hospital.

Fukuoka airport does not have this facility yet and you have to queue up for more than 30mins for security check for ""Check-in luggage"" before you check yourself in the flight at the counter. After then you have to queue up at least another 30mins before immigration for the hand carry luggage for security check. Only 3 lanes are available and takes ages to go thru. You will definitely encounter this without fail If your flight is in the morning taking off between 10am-12pm because there are more than 7 flights taking off between this 2 hours at this single run-way small airport. And check-in only starts 2 hours before departure but counter opens only 8am in the morning. It is just a bad arrangement in allocating the flights during the day. Bad management. Even if you are flying on Business class you are still required to queue up and no priority lane available at all. It is complete waste of time after traveling other airports in the worlds even within Asia (Shanghai Bangkok Vietnam etc) Fukuoka is the worst by far.

Terminal is quite large for a regional airport and of a modern design. Passport control seemed quick and efficient in all queues apart from mine I guess I was just unlucky in getting the fussiest immigration officer in Madeira I eventually hopped over the ropes to the next desk and was processed immediately. Bags arrived quickly and I reckon the whole process from disembarkation to clearing customs took no more than 15 minutes albeit the airport wasn't busy at the time. Departure - no major problems. Just two check-in desks open for my flight so a queue built up quickly and only one member of staff carrying out security / boarding card checks en-route to the airside area. Once airside plenty of retail opportunities but limited seating both in the terminal area and at the departure gates. Passport control has several automated e-passport lanes in addition to good old fashioned immigration officers. Toilets were clean. All in all the departure experience was quick and painless but this was on a quiet Saturday morning and apart from my half-full A319 there was only one other small turboprop aircraft on the apron.

Check-in fast and efficient but when multiple departures are called together the check-in area simply cannot cope with the queues as the ground floor level just doesn't have enough floor space to deal with hundreds of passengers and cases. Most of the airport's facilities are on the first floor. Main criticism is the lack of seating before security which probably explains why everyone seems to crowd around the windows to watch take-offs & landings! Security is quick efficient and stress- free. There are several cafes/bars/shops before and after security; nothing spectacular but adequate for the average passenger's needs (prices weren't hugely elevated either which makes a nice change). Avoid the taxis and buy a bus ticket for 2.50 PLN which gets you to or from the city centre in 30 minutes (bus 210 which runs 1/2 hourly and stops near the main bus/rail station).

If you are not skiing on a Saturday when it appears to be bedlam (as it is not a big place) it is a fast modern and clean place. Fitting are generally high quality. It is true that it can be annoying that the airline lounges are before security as you can't stay in them up until the last minute as the time to clear security is highly variable. It can be very fast at slack periods or there may be quite a queue. If you want a high quality Swiss watch all the brands are there in Duty Free - an impressive selection. If you want to bring home Swiss food don't wait to clear passport control - it will cost you an arm and a leg. You should use the shops near the train terminal. The airport is simple to find bang on a motorway and the train station is built in. For info the most convenient car park the P1 is more expensive than the others. The P26 is the best.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-12-10,"To help people avoid the problems that Jenny Eckersley encountered here are a few tips. First of all the signs are for Ferney (note the second ""e"") because that is the French town next to the airport. The only reason for using the French sector even if you are travelling on into France is to pick up a French rental car. In this case follow the ""Secteur Francais"" signs before passport control (do not go through Swiss passport control) and you will arrive at the French car rental desks. (You will need to ask a baggage handler to go and fetch any checked luggage from the Swiss side.) This does not apply if you are arriving from France as you will be in the French sector to begin with. Or if you aren't renting a French car exit through Switzerland where you will have the full range of transport options including trains to the main station and on to France. If you have rented a French car on leaving the airport follow the signs back to Geneva (it's hardly the airport's fault that the French authorities don't sign their roads very well) and cross back into Switzerland. You will go under the airport runway and link up with the Swiss autoroute that passes in front of the airport. Take this in the direction of Geneva (not Lausanne) and continue on the autotroute until you reach the Bardonnex customs post. From there you will link directly on to the A40. On the way back come off the A40 at Bardonnex and follow the autoroute to the airport. Follow the signs for ""secteur francais"" to return your car then go to the Swiss side to check in for flights to countries other than France. If in doubt ask the people at the rental desk for directions to your destination. As for walking miles to the B gates there are travellators. You actually have to walk very little at all. Walks to the gates at Heathrow or Gatwick are much more arduous. Geneva is actually one of the most compact best managed airports I have used. It is true that if you want to shop or eat stay landside as long as possible. Airside most of the facilities are in the main terminal so avoid going to the gates until as late as possible. They really are just pre- boarding holding areas (as they are in most airports).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Yes the security incident last year was dreadful and people have coped admirably but this should not allow BAA / Ferrovial to gloss over the underlying issues with an airport that is ""overtrading"" until the extension is completed. Until this happens some simple things could be done to make our lives easier and some real bugbears exist. On International arrivals why is the moving walkway always closed for maintenance / switched-off as it was on January 25th? They do not however switch off the message ""you are approaching a moving walkway"" - actually it is not working - first impressions count and this is not good. Why does baggage always take around at least 30 mins to arrive as it did on February 2nd (as usual)? Most airports around the world are much faster than this and BAA have to take a hard look at itself on this one - are the baggage handlers understaffed? It certainly looks like it and if they are they have my sympathy what with the growth of the airport. I recently used the new SkyLounge and overall it was a pleasant experience with nice staff. On a recent ski holiday flight I was subject to the usual crowd of happy skiers all off on their break and Glasgow Airport was struggling to cope. There appeared to be a ""manager"" running around with a walkie-talkie telling check-in staff not to overload the baggage belts - whilst we were all standing there. I am not sure what good this did as in my case it just seemed to annoy the check-in staff all the more on what was clearly a day that they all dread (with some justification it seems). There are some highlights. The ""mature"" gentleman in the whisky area of the duty free shop is very knowledgeable and friendly and the Caffe Nero is very small but has great staff and coffee. All in all this place is saved by the generally good natured attitude of the staff despite some inconsistent management practices and general failure to recognise that people are not likely to accept this mess without having a voice. It's all very well expanding the retail side of an airport but the priority should be a ""back to basics"" campaign from the top down in terms of customer experience in simple things like check-in baggage and moving walkways.

Arriving on Jetstar from Sydney we had to negotiate the stairs (no airbridges) then literally battle our way between two 30m lines of passengers, with hand baggage, waiting to board flights. The gap between the lines was about half a metre and my small wheeled back-pack was hitting the bags of the waiting passengers. What a totally ludicrous situation! Surely the designers of the upgrade could foresee such a situation and keep arriving passengers separated from those queued to board. Departure 5 days later at 0700 was much more comfortable experience through gate 3 at the other end of the airport.

gold-coast-airport,/airport-reviews/gold-coast-airport,Gold Coast Airport customer review,J Maley,Australia,2012-12-28,"Recently used this airport having not been here in about 5 years. They have done a major upgrade since then. I arrived on a Thursday evening and was off the plane and in my hire car in a matter of a few minutes - all good and smooth. The terminal is small so it was easy with the rental cars right outside the front door. However the return journey the next day was the exact opposite. I checked in and went to the Security Screening area. I was flying Business Class and was delighted to note there was a separate lane for Business/Platinum passengers especially as the queues were enormous. However despite the red carpet and gold railings for the priority queue this system was not being manned and this entry point was one of the two that had the enormous queue. I tried to get towards the front to see if the staff would push me through but they were far away and ignored you. I saw several other people try to find the entrance to the ""fast track"" security clearance but it did not work for them either. Normally this would be nothing more than an irritant but on this occasion it was a lot more than that. The queues were enormous and after spending 20 minutes in the queue my flight was starting to board and I had to ask to be let to the front of the queue which the people in front were agreeable to. I estimate it would have taken about another 10 minutes to clear Security otherwise i.e. a total of 30 minutes. Normally to get to the Gold Coast I fly to Brisbane and hire a car - I will return to that and recommend others do the same.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
gold-coast-airport,/airport-reviews/gold-coast-airport,Gold Coast Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,This is an airport fresh from major renovations and for domestic flights it works. However for international flights it is abysmal. In the mornings there are 4 international flights arriving within minutes of each other. 3 wide bodied dual aisle aircraft from Asian destinations and a smaller aircraft from NZ. The inbound duty free area is ridiculously small and acts more of a choke point for the long queues in immigration with people collecting duty free obstructing Australian passport holders from moving through. There are only 2 baggage carousels despite the 4 flights meaning that the baggage from my flight could not be unloaded onto the carousel as it was jam packed with bags from the slightly earlier Jetstar from Osaka. The Japanese owners of these bags could not collect them because they were stuck waiting for the single immigration official to clear them into Australia. It was over an hour after exiting the aircraft before my bag showed itself. Then faced another jammed line through customs.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The latter are long overdue & far superior being lighter more spacious and with a much better range of food and drink outlets. On the negative side watching many newly arrived passengers wandering aimlessly through the building looking for the baggage arrival area suggests that signage needs to be improved. Having been caught twice in heavy rain while crossing between the aircraft and terminal buildings I can't understand why the renovations apparently do not appear to include any plans to install aerobridges to protect the presumably significant number of passengers from the vagaries of the Gold Coast weather.

Single runway so only one plane can land/take-off at a time. Very compact with everything close by. A very short stroll from the aircraft to the terminal where 2 Passport Kiosks quickly processed everyone. The Baggage Claim is one conveyor and there are limited toilet facilities before getting to Arrivals Hall. Arrivals is mid-way between the 4 Check-in Desks and the Security Scanning. Outside the airport there is a taxi rank usually stocked with cars for each flight and the bus to the centre of Gothenburg. Picnic tables are still outside on the grass where you can relax. Security is OK and then a smallish Departure Lounge which is very busy if 2 flights are going at similar times. The Duty Free has various things but no alcohol. There is a cafe selling hot and cold drinks sandwiches and similar and a small bar selling drinks. There are 3 Departure Doors of which Gate 2 has Passport Control for non-Schengen flights.

Arrival is at best a free for all with queuing outside exposed to the elements. Departure is just a joke. On the day we departed the queue for security occupied the majority of the check-in hall disrupting most of the check-in desks as it wound around the building. Having joined the queue to ensure that we made our flight we stood for 1.5 hours while people were rushed through to catch their flights. It appears the best solution at Grenoble is not to join the queue at all but to wait until they are rushing people through and get taken to the front and straight through security. The fun really started when we came to board. Having watched our luggage loaded to one aircraft at least we knew the plane we would be boarding! Wrong! Initially the wrong flight was called they called the flight 1 hour later. having questioned the staff at the departure gate they realised there take and called the correct flight number. As we walked to the plane across the tarmac we realised they were taking us to the wrong plane same airline. Having questioned the staff they were persuaded that the other plane on the apron was the correct plane! Very unpleasant experience.

Not on our boarding pass, we just knew it was ""A"" - so after going through all the shops, so many shops, eventually we came to the gates. It was there we found a small screen that scrolled and we found our gate. Same with going to domestic, again very hard to find our gate number and to know whether we were even walking the miles in the right direction. What do they have against people knowing where they need to be? We made sure we purchased nothing in this airport due to the price. You know all they need is a little attention to detail (like displaying gate/flights in an obvious way), to make this airport so much better.

However few restaurants once you get after the security check and the few coffee shops airside are a rip-off. Check-in (especially international check-ins) and security can sometimes have long queues. Last time when I transferred domestically in this airport I had to de-plane in Area A (the airplane parked at the international area as it was going to fly a international flight next) got on a bus that dropped me at the Area A domestic arrivals run across the airport (I'd say a kilometre long) to the departures lobby (no transfer desks airside) get to China Southern's domestic check-in counter to print my next boarding pass and go through security again to enter Area B and made it to the gate just in time. Luckily my previous flight wasn't delayed and I was flying 1st class so I can cut the lines I didn't miss the flight. Their 50 mins minimum transfer time is really tight.

Question this and some shops relent and revert back to the official exchange rate others won't and it's time to walk away.

The bags were sealed before we had even paid for the rum so there was no chance to put the receipt inside assuming that is the ticket they were referring to.

Terminal 2 is mainly used for charter flights from Miami. This terminal was built few years ago and was mainly for international flights however seemed quite small and impractical. Since tourism kept increasing every year a new international terminal was needed. Terminal 3 started on 1998. Since it is not a big airport I think is running fairly well. I had been in Havana 5 times arriving from different countries. As a rule Immigration is fairly quick although I found it particularly slow one night when 3 flights from Europe arrived almost at the same time (1 hour waiting) . Luggage collection is OK. Public transport from Terminal 3 is non existing but they are plenty of taxis and the ride to the center takes no more than 30 minutes.

I purposely booked flights to Italy that included layovers in Helsinki both coming and going. On arrival to Vantaa on a Sunday morning I was able to easily get information on how to get into the city (two convenient bus options) and a very well-stocked tourist kiosk had great maps and walking tour suggestions in multiple languages. Pretty much everyone I dealt with spoke excellent English with no apparent problem with dealing with a non-Finnish speaker (not always the case on the Finnair flights). My layovers were long enough that I spent two nights in the airport and I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively comfortable this was. The airport had free wifi that had a strong signal (or whatever you call it) and was extremely easy to log onto. Also lots of electric outlets available to recharge devices. There were both brightly lit and diimmly lit areas for trying to settle in for the night to rest a bit and the ones close to the Terminal 2 entrances that I stayed by felt very safe and secure. At the far end of Terminal 2 (across from the new Starbuck's which was overpriced by US standards) is a more or less full service 24 hour grocery store. This was great for getting food and bottled water at something like one-third of the price that the regular airport kiosks charged and also great for loading up on food souvenirs like chocolate and licorice before flying out. Another thing I appreciated was that credit cards were welcome for even the smallest purchases. I was out of Euros on my way back to the states but my credit card was happily accepted for transactions as small as a postcard and postage stamp. Lines for security and passport control were 1-2 minutes in each case for me so that was fine too.

We last used Heraklion 6 years ago and remembered little apart from the crowding - until we read the reference about the entertainment value of the bottom step from the duty free as we'd been entertained too! Obviously Heraklion has been redeveloped since then because there's much more space and no longer an irregular bottom step from the duty free. On arrival we too did have a long wait for our bags and I would agree that it was not easy to find which carousel was to be used. While I waited for the suitcase my wife went through to process our car rental pick-up and had it all sorted long before our bag came through. Leaving from Heraklion was far easier than departures we've had from other Greek airports.

We had to go back through security right through the check-in area through more security to find Gate 1 at the other end of the terminal building.

The usual long queues at immigration yet (as always) it never seems to take more than 10 minutes to clear immigration. Bags on the belt about 15 minutes after landing. The airport is still as clean and efficient as it has always been. In-town check-in still works incredibly well. Another positive is that some of the seating in the departure area immediately after immigration has returned - this is much-needed seating.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2014-12-04,Bangkok to Hong Kong return. This airport always amazes me of how quick and smooth everything works when you contemplate on the size and the volume of incoming and departing flights! Arrival a breeze. Hong Kong border officers do not stamp your passports any more. All is scanned in their systems and you get a small 4x4cm square paper with your passport info arrival and length of permitted stay. All takes a few moments. Many if not all airports in Asia and the west now seem so sluggish compared. Departures as well a breeze including security check. Train from and to the city is quick and clean. Wifi working and reasonable speed.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Mejia,Philippines,2014-11-05,I find HKG's layout quite confusing and dizzying because of the Y shaped building configuration. About a decade back there was a common lounge area in the middle between the gates and the shops which is a good common meeting place for travel companions. It's gone now replaced by more shops. The only place you can actually sit down is in the gate area or (if you're lucky) in the food court upstairs. Food selection really not as extensive as Changi and not as much to do either. Immigration and check in was efficient and access to public transport is fantastic (which is good because it is quite a distance to city centre).,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-10-31,Hong Kong airport is certainly very clean and has good facilities (water fountains etc) and plenty seating in the gate areas. Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

It's fairly soulless is the only criticism I could possibly make about it. But for efficiency it is hard to beat. Immigration procedures were quick and easy luggage was fast to arrive and everything is so clearly posted. I loved too that those waiting for loved ones could actually see them on monitors before they emerged. It's a shame that Australia and USA have extra bag checks at boarding so you can't purchase water for the flight itself even after security. Guess those are the rules so be it. Altogether HK airport makes most western airports look very shabby inefficient under-staffed and unfriendly in comparison so I was pleased to go to Canada via here even if it made for longer flights.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,C Brown,United Kingdom,2014-04-11,Being one of only three 5 star Skytrax rated airports in the world it doesn't take long to see why. The airport is incredibly clean well sized and has plenty of on site amenities. On arrival I was through immigration in next to no time but the walk and then train ride from the gate was maddeningly long. The Airport Express train is one of the most expensive options to get to the city but by many standards is still an absolute bargain. My one big gripe with Hong Kong airport is actually about how functional it all is. Style makes way for function in everything. It is an incredibly boring affair with no flair or flourishes to make up for the monotony of it all. Personally I found the signage to be okay not brilliant and not nearly as good bright yellow signage commonly found in European airports. Some of the amenities are also really expensive ($200HKD for a shower seemed rather steep to me!) and the facilities for eating and drinking landside are a little lacking (Terminal 2 is better but most airlines use Terminal 1). One more moan - The time from gate to takeoff. The captain on my flight warned us that the taxi would take at least 20 minutes at minimum and that this is a regular affair at Hong Kong Airport. I have also learnt from several sources that Cathay Pacific leave transfer times between connecting flights that they have booked perilously short. Passengers have to be rushed through the airport by staff who meet them at the gate. They manage to get onto their connecting flights but sadly their luggage doesn't join them! Putting my moaning to one side this is a good airport with an excellent reputation and I can see why.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-01-10,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are. It's only saving grace is that the time to the airport is basically unchanging from most places so you can minimise your time there by leaving as late as possible!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Airport is generally clean although some glass windows are sometimes dirty. Facilities are sufficient but the observation deck is not an impressive spot to visit. However ground staff lack service enthusiasm. Check-in staff were generally efficient but they don't try their best to help the customers such as not notifying the passengers that the aircraft and the seat are changed which I experienced when Cathay Pacific changed the B777-300 to B747-400.

I'm not sure I agree as I found the airport to be as efficient as on previous occasions – quick immigration clearance despite long queues and on the MTR into town about 30 mins after landing. However the airport seems to be heading the way of British airports and is becoming a shopping centre first and an airport second. The upper level airside used to have lots of comfy seats but these have now been removed to make way for even more ""shopping opportunities” and restaurants – yet there is still plenty of unused space which could be used for seats! It seems that the only way to get a seat without buying something is to head straight for the gates where there is lots of seating (and better views of the runways). My other complaint is that there is still hardly anywhere to buy bottled drinks etc. airside – there are several branches of Relay towards the gates but they have a poor range of products compared to their European stores. Is it really too much to ask to have a few branches of 7-11 or OK at HKG?

Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports.

For a place that is supposed to welcome people to a tropical paradise it is heavy and dark concrete architecture. There needs to be more wood greenery and updates to the fixtures. If you are taking Hawaiian Airlines to a connecting neighbor island flight be prepared to walk if you are in the far terminal where some mainland and international flights are parked. Its even a farther walk (or ride on the Wiki-wiki shuttle) if you're on Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Seattle parked at the far terminal and we had less than an hour to our connecting flight to Hilo. It was a mad dash with several co-passengers in tow scrambling for directions. Fortunately we made it in time. The airport is trying to make improvements and there are better dining options along with more shopping for people waiting at the gates for their flight.

Upon exiting the aircraft we had a reasonable length walk (about 10 minutes) to reach US immigration. Out of a possible 30 or so desks there were about six open for international passengers at that time of night. The immigration officer we saw was polite and processed us smoothly. We did not have to line up for very long before being processed but I did note that more people had joined a line once we had cleared immigration. It would I think take some considerable time to clear immigration here if there had been another international flight arriving. I saw the Global Entry kiosks before arriving at Immigration but I did not see anyone use these at the time I passed them. (As a UK citizen I am ineligible to use such a service). Baggage for our flight came off quite quickly. One thing I have now noticed is that when the customs form is handed in you now have to show your passport to them also. The taxi rank was not well sign-posted outside and the dispatcher had isolated himself in a glass box!. Once we had managed to communicate with this individual the taxi arrived soon afterwards.

Since I did not fly in directly to IAH from overseas I did not experience the horrid queues mentioned in earlier reviews. On the contrary I found terminal A pretty efficient coming in and going out. Food choices may be limited and free wifi options are just on the free 45 minutes provided by Boingo but the airport served its purpose. Baggage was out pretty quickly (the fact that we were on a 45 seater CRJ 900 made the wait less painful as we had to wait for only a few bags out the carousel).

A nice landscaped and well signed access road takes you to the terminal with ample parking. The only drawback there are just 2 (1 each for domestic and international) entrance points and 2 exit points at dep and arrival levels for passengers and these get very crowded. The main terminal hall is airy well lit and smack clean. One doesnt feel congested with a good and organised number of check in counters. Very impressed to find a laptop and mobile charging kiosk in the checkin hall itself .The dep area has an array of different food joints duty free shops (overpriced) children play area small smoking room and also a prayer hall. The arrival hall is pleasant with quick immigrations except that on most occasions it takes a good while for baggage to come on the belt.

A little overkill i think . On arrival in Muscat some 5 hours later I looked in rucksack and realised that I had inadvertantly packed a bottle of shower gel and toothpaste - both were not allowed - and were not noted by the three searches.

Getting out similar this year now 3 funnels for customs which feed into each other creating one big bottle neck with those who are leaving it to the last minute trying to push through to the front have made what worked into a disaster.

Airport itself is nice but there are major drawbacks from using this airport. Firstly there is a rather expensive and needless Airport Development fee of 10 euro for every passenger departing this airport. Check in was smooth but we all had to line up to pay the 10 euro fee. After which they scan your boarding pass and let you into security. Again security was fast and efficient as was boarding. We can't complain about these issues. When we arrived back here we got though passport control quickly and then we discovered another rip off that this airport has. It charges double the parking rates that Dublin charges. My advice is to use a different airport that does not try to rip passengers off. Knock is in the middle of nowhere charges 10 euro per person to leave the airport and double the car parking rates of all the other airports within 2 hours drive of it.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The baggage is often available as soon as you arrive after a short walk from the plane. Quite often I've been outside the airport within ten minutes of the flight touching down. On departures the security queue and process can be a little tedious if there are a few flights departing at about the same time and there's only the minimum of facilities in the departure lounge (although there is free wi-fi). The car park is a bit more expensive than it should be; if you're away for a weekend it seems very pricey (currently the first day costs £11.50 but £3.50 thereafter). That might not seem too much but remember that this is a small airport situated in an area with plenty of spare land.

But IST is very functional with excellent shopping and eating options efficient lines at the security check and a size which is not too large that one gets lost in the airport. My only complaints are a lack of free wifi not enough places to sit and a lack of luggage trolleys (probably due to the number of passengers at the airport) and the need for a security check while arriving from an Asian destination if in transit (a security check is not needed if arriving from the U.S. and in transit).

When we flew (to FRA on THY June 2014) one had to go through full security before entering the terminal. There wasn't obviously anyone to help if a passenger were too frail to lift ones (not yet checked) bags onto a table above waist level for the x-ray. So we then assumed that IST just does security in a different order having cleared security we bought water for the flight (at reasonable prices) before passport control. Only after passport control can you see that there's a second identical security check and you have to discard that water. Still thirsty or hungry? The final set of shops and restaurants have the most outrageous prices you have ever encountered in any airport anywhere. So we had about $10 worth of Turkish lira left but could buy almost nothing with it. Why not exchange it for € or $ at the currency exchange? No they say the amount we had didn't meet their minimum! The roads to IST from Sultanahmet were fast and uncrowded at least at 6am. The ticketing check-in agents were unusually friendly and efficient; the passport control line was really long but moved quickly. Fairly crowded waiting at the gate (but there was decent seating) and then we were jam-packed standing onto a bus to get to the plane.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Robert Marshall,United Kingdom,2013-08-27,This is now a very busy hub airport for Turkish Airlines. A fair wait for aircraft to reach available airbridge or remote stand after touchdown. We used both the international and domestic terminals. Airbridges available for inbound flight from London and onward domestic flight to Bodrum. Remote stand and bus transfer to domestic terminal coming back. Airbridge available for flight back to London. Layover in either terminal was no longer than 1.5 hours. Fairly lengthy queues for non-Turkish passport holders at immigration. Certainly nothing of the order that non-EU passport holders would face on arrival in the UK. Immigration officers were efficient and good humoured. We had pre-purchased Turkish e-VISAs via the Turkish Government's web site and would definitely recommend that especially if arriving at particularly busy times or face an additional queue of 20+ minutes to obtain your Turkish visa then queue up for immigration control. As others have stated signage in the terminals in English is not good and could definitely be improved upon. Security screening staff were fine. Did not find them any better or worse than those at UK airports. Again as others have said plenty of places to eat and drink as long as you are prepared to pay the prices for food and drink (post security screening) which were as we anticipated expensive but comparable to other airports we've used.

The main problem is queuing on arrival one queues for visa (if necessary) and then to have it checked for immigration (an hour in my case). On departure you queue for security before you enter the building (a few minutes) for check-in (about 15 mins in my case but by the time I got to the desk the queue was about 4-5 times longer than when I joined it) and then for emigration and a second security check. Fortunately a friend had advised me to arrive at least 2 hours before departure I endorse that. I recommend the metro and tram to get to the city centre the price is a tenth or less of a taxi or the shuttle bus and the time is about the same given Istanbul's traffic. Be aware it does require a change if you have a lot of luggage and also there is not a metro/tram stop near all hotels but if there is one it is a reliable and cheap alternative.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

With travelators out of action the walk was extremely stressful. Rounding the corner to the gate we were confronted by another long line to pass through another x ray security check. Thankfully a man let us take his place at the head of the queue.

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,T Adams,United States,2013-08-01,The airport has made great strides in the past 5 or 6 years to get passengers processed quickly and efficiently. However with the exception of the new domestic terminal this airport is very old with poor air-conditioning. Check in process for the international terminal is easy. Plenty of room. Only passengers actually flying are allowed at the check in area. The next step of going through immigration is much quicker than before as more immigration counters and agents have been added. However beware the immigration officers at this airport are very rude disrespectful and overall have an arrogant attitude to all. Once through immigration the process to get to your gate is easy with plenty of shops and restrooms and dining. It's just that the building is old dated and not enough AC. On inbound flights the process of passing through immigration for foreigners has improved dramatically and I now consider it one of the fastest airports that I know of to pass through immigration. However where Soekarno-Hatta airport fails is in the baggage claim customs and parking. Baggage claim facilities are ancient slow and crowded. Once you claim your baggage you must than have all your baggage go through an x-ray machine. This is ok except there is only one queue and one x-ray machine which means standing in what resembles a queue with many people jumping in front. Once you finally exit the baggage claim area you will be barraged by scores of locals trying to provide you with transportation to Jakarta.

The positives: quick processing of luggage on arrival and quick check-in on departure. Facilities clean and well maintained. As others have commented lots of eating options with competitive prices (for an airport). Staff friendly. Departure halls airy and well lit with some nice shops. There is also an observations deck in the public area. Negatives: On arrival on a domestic flight the corridor to the baggage claim area is gloomy with few windows. Also signage is v.poor. I almost missed the escalator down to baggage claim and finding the bus terminal for the hotel shuttles is not easy. Certainly this airport needs to seriously improve the signs throughout the building otherwise lots of potential to be a v.good airport.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I needed to go to the domestic side to pick up a car. Well for a start you get terminal A and B (would it really kill someone to put 'Int' & 'Dom' after A & B? Anyhow I followed the car rental signs and took the lift though car rentals were listed on 2 seperate floors with no clue why. I went to the nearest one which seemed to be Europcar (sadly no the company I was using) so back in the lift. When I returned the car again the signs came thick and fast along with the turns in the road all very confusing but I managed to keen in the correct lane until the last when all of a sudden the car rental lane was only valid for some companies leaving me a split second to try and find the companies logo!

Instantly impressed by the extraordinarily friendly ground staff at the airport. Immigration and customs were very efficient and I did not expect actually a smile and a warm greeting from a custom officer which I met only in Japan. Generally the airport service is one of the best I have experienced and I think this is Japanese culture. Airport was spotlessly clean and janitors were always present in the airport to clean the terminal. Facilities in the terminal were fine but what impressed me the most was the Sky View observation building where I stayed for 2 hours for plane spotting. No wonder it was very famous for its beautiful scenery and the shops were great as well with kind staff. Return flight 8 days later to Hong Kong very early in the morning (9:10 flight). There were just a few people and the terminal was quiet. Relaxing music was played which made my stay in the departure lounge extremely comfortable. Still warm smile and greeting from check in and security check staff. The other airport in Osaka Osaka Itami International Airport is almost as good as Kansai Airport.

On International Flights the usual European Rules on liquids apply. Again very quickly processed down an escalator and into International Departures which is a long thin hall backing the piers with the usual selection of shops. There is free WiFi available.

Directional signage throughout the airport is difficult to find and not clear. When I departed my plane upon arriving in Kansas City I was unable to find my way out of the gate area. There was no sign directing me where to go. When arriving at the airport at the end of my trip the security signs directed passengers to choose the right or left line; however the agent was partial to taking people from the right line rather than alternating lines. The gate areas have very little seating unless you want to walk and sit at another gate. The corridors in the entire airport are narrow and make it difficult to move around as you are always in someone's way. The bathrooms are lacking all around and they are filthy. There is a very slim selection of food options so the lines are extremely long and the staff rude.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,F Martin,United States,2014-07-03,There are good things and bad things about the set up of this airport. The biggest plus is the small size which makes it easy to get to where you need to go without having to walk through long sections of stores restaurants lounges etc. However that's because they don't have those amenities except for a couple so if you are a seasoned traveler who expects those you're out of luck. There isn't any real connection to public transportation here (only buses in KC) so you have to take a taxi use a shuttle to your hotel or pay to park in the lot and take a shuttle to and from the lot to the airport. The bathrooms are generally clean and not busy. The waiting areas are small but I've never seen it too crowded either. Security is right there at the waiting area so there's little walking you need to do between entering the airport and getting to your gate. The airline availability here is not ideal but it's adequate to get by. Basically if you aren't expecting to spend much time at the airport it can be quite nice to breeze in run through security and sit down ready to board your flight. If you are used to the amenities of bigger airports expect to be disappointed. Although there is talk of a huge billion dollar plus expansion to be done at the airport but that all depends on whether the people here want their tax dollars to pay for it and so far the attitude has not been positive.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

Regardless of which class you fly everyone has to queue to get inside the airport where their tickets are checked (check #1). In the age of e-tickets this was difficult as the security guard couldn't read the tickets and so made a show of going over every single word. Those who didn't have their e-tickets printed out had to argue their way in. I understand this policy as it keeps well- wishes out of the airport - but seriously they could make it a lot easier and friendly. Then you have to scan your bag (security check #2). Check-in on Thai with a Gold Card was fast but unfriendly. Make sure you have a baggage tag for your hand luggage as you will need to show this before going up the escalator (check #3). Passport formalities were quick but then you have to go and get your hand luggage scanned and searched (check #4) and your hand luggage tag stamped (check #5) before getting your ticket stamped (check #6) to show you had undergone this process.

My mother and I plus several other EasyJet passengers had to ask where the check in desk was as it was not clearly sign posted and the airport was very busy with long queues. After waiting at the Baggage Drop off I was told when I reached the desk that as I only had hand luggage I didn't need to be at that desk! It would be very helpful if there could be a sign saying that passengers flying with just hand luggage may proceed to wherever they have to go next rather than stand in a queue they needn't be in. Also could there be signs (or maybe a friendly human) informing passengers when they need to have their passport/boarding pass ready so that they don't hold the queue up any more than need be. Plus signs well in advance saying what items need to be taken out of their luggage before its scanned as again that can cause unnecessary delays. Finally could ALL airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be nervous or first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely. Travellers can be stopped from flying if they are aggressive or rude to staff so could airport workers return the courtesy as good manners cost nothing but go a long way. Also could the toilets have either paper towels or hand dryers as there was nothing to dry my hands on!,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It is rather a long walk to/from non-Schengen flights but apart from that it was a good experience: no queues for passport checks or security efficient staff reasonable selection of shops and cafes plenty of seating.

keflavik-airport,/airport-reviews/keflavik-airport,Keflavik Airport customer review,A Ross,United Kingdom,2013-06-26,Keflavik sells itself on being the small airport with big connections. It's certainly that. All flights are scheduled to arrive/depart same time in order to minimise wait times which is good but means long queues at security taciturn and quite frankly rude staff. Restaurants are full to bursting long queues (Icelandair - main carrier charges for meals so most people buy at the airport). There is a very confusing passport control system dead ends poor signage and lack of toilets. Gate area is a kind of rabbit warren on stilts with corridors the size of a school hallway; it's hard to know where to go. Being Iceland it's organised chaos so nothing actually goes wrong just that you will feel your blood boil and stress levels will go off the scale - just what you want as you settle in to your long haul flight.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The terminal seems too small to accommodate the 3 flights that were boarding simultaneously. There were not enough chairs and most people were either standing or sitting on the floor. The lines for flights to JFK and Dulles taking off from adjacent gates were indistinguishable. A third flight to the U.S. was scheduled to take off at the same time as the flight to JFK further pressing the capacity of the terminal.

When we eventually got through check-in the security lines were the next obstacle. Although these were quick the need to take cameras out of bags along with everything else was odd.

There are no signs to indicate security is the first thing you encounter so you get caught off guard if you need to take things from your bag like electronic equipment. Instructions on what can and can't go through appear half way down the queue. Past passport control you have to present your ticket to an officer to let you into the gate.

keflavik-airport,/airport-reviews/keflavik-airport,Keflavik Airport customer review,Niels Jansen,NA,2008-11-15,This is a great airport. It is one of the few airports offering the opportunity to do tax free shopping on arrival. Both arriving and leaving was a breeze (as we were still within Schengen area). Staff friendly and competent and in arrivals a lot of useful information material on Iceland and Reykjavik is available. When leaving we spent some time in a very pleasant atrium-like space where all shops and eateries are concentrated. I must say that with the devaluation of the kronur price levels were friendly for visitors from euro-countries so we did some shopping. Quality of the shops in our opinion was really good. Keep in mind that many Icelandic shops offer the possibility to get a refund of VAT (almost 25%!) . Ask for the special coupon when making a purchase. If the sum exceeds 5000 kr you must get it stamped by customs first. After this you will get the refund from the landsbanki office in the departures area. You can choose between a cash refund in kronur or a refund in euro/GBP/USD to your credit card (which may take some time). The only problem with the airport is transport to Reykjavik. Most visitors who are not being picked up will depend on the Flybuss. Even though this was adequate for us it got really full and was not too comfortable. I have the feeling that it left when all seats were occupied without picking up everybody who needed transport.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

VV does not appear to check bags through to final destination so had to pick up bags and recheck in KBP. Terminal B is not impressive. The domestic baggage belt is tiny so it will be a scrum to get your bag. The entire terminal has only 2 jet bridges so there's an excellent chance you'll be riding a bus to the terminal and plane (the NYC flight does use a gate due to the extra security). I had a 2.5 hour layover and when my bag finally arrived I discovered I couldn't check in yet. There were a few places to eat in the arrivals area and a couple other shops. I joined the others staring at the departure board waiting for the check in counter to be posted. BT has its own check in staff so you won't be lined up with VV. Passport control was fairly quick and so was security. After you past security in the international half of the terminal there are 3 duty free shops (2 were closed) and about 3 cafes. That's it for shopping so you won't be picking up any last minute souvenirs. There's also no place to change money so if you don't spend all your hyrvnia in duty free or at the expensive (by Ukraine standards) cafes you are out of luck.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

My experiences of baggage reclaim support other comments - theres still much work to be done here. On entry also queues can be frustrating and slow.

Signage is poor it is a very old Soviet building that has had a cosmetic decoration yet is simply not big enough to handle extra traffic. The check in procedure is a joke only one belt shared with 6 check in desks passengers then have to leave by an exit door and go outside around the back to a second building housing the departure gates. The departure area is basically 1 room with a duty free shop no bigger than 15m m2 There is seating for only around 60 while when I was there more than 200 people crowded into the room. No facilities for refreshments and the plasma screens show no flight info just weather reports. Expect pandamonium as military police airline staff airport officials and heavies in black bomber jackets all seemingly want to control things with the result being chaos. Incoming passengers face piles of baggage passed directly from the tarmac through a door there is no reclaim hall-just a 6m corridor. This place makes Boryspil look like a palace. The only advantage is the 7 km from the centre of Kiev as opposed to KBP 33km. All the same be wary of taxi drivers asking for extortionate fees to unsuspecting arrivals- better to get a bus from just outside main entrance. There is an ATM machine to get some Hirivna.This airport is a long way towards being capable of the same standards offered by KBPand will be interesting to see if the lower fares offered by Wizz can actually benefit customers who expect more.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

It is a well-presented and apparently well-maintained airport with reasonable functionality and transport links. I will focus on the truly negative aspect for this review as it needs highlighting: queuing at Immigration Control. This applies to both arriving and departing passengers, and the latter seems quite unique to KLIA. Upon arrival at KLIA, it is quite normal to join a queue for foreign passports that will last some 20 minutes or more. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of passenger-flow monitoring and accommodating peak periods. When going through ticket presentation from check-in to security, at KLIA there is a row of Immigration desks for passport/biometrics capture. My experiences over the last 17 years have shown this to be a very quiet area, so I was particularly surprised at the queues that I had to join last Wednesday (24th). I don't know if there was a unique event or incident that contributed to this, but everything seemed normal to that point. My queue lasted 20 minutes, and was the quicker queue as an extra desk opened up towards the end. Up to that point, there were three desks out of 7+ open for foreign passports, with an extra two for ""First and Business Class"" that did not call over any passengers to alleviate the queue when they were not serving anyone.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-10-31,KLIA feels like it used to be a top-notch airport but has fallen to neglectful bad habits. It's just not well kept and feels a little dirty and cheaply run. The shops are okay (standard big-Asia-airport shops) but still have a sort of tacky make-shift feel about them unlike Singapore or Hong Kong and more like some Manila terminals or SVO (Moscow). My biggest complaint about this airport which I didn't spend a very long time in is the immigration queues. I didn't have any luggage but the queue for immigration was very slow moving. This is partly due to the number of Chinese nationals trying to enter (on my flight from Hong Kong) - and it certainly slows things down a bit when immigration staff insist on checking return flight bookings for certain passports (and in some cases rejecting them - something I have never seen before - telling passengers to contact their airline for assistance after being denied entry initially!). As a British passport holder getting past the lady at immigration was very smooth but there simply weren't enough staff for it to be acceptable by today's standards for big airports - particularly if they insist on checking Chinese peoples itineraries. My other gripe is the lack of reasonable coffee in departures - the best you can find is a McCafe without paying silly money: there is no other major coffee chain inside the airport (that I could easily find and at 6am I was looking pretty hard!).,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2014-10-28,"Flew recently with Malaysian from Bangkok to Kinabalu and back via Kuala Lumpur. The waiting times for both connections were quite bad with 9 hours on my way there and the same on my return. I have always had good or above average experiences with KLIA1 however my flights were always during the day. My last connection was with the same airline from Bangkok to Sydney and all went well without a hitch. My loudest criticism and a shame to KLIA's managers is the lack of support for ""real late night"" travelers. I arrived to KUL from Kota Kinabalu 2.20am (flight to Bangkok 9.10am) and was completely relaxed even if I found information regarding transportation non existent for anyone landing after 1.30am! Sama Sama express in the airside has more or less acceptable rates for a 6 hours nap but showed no availability online. Checking the reception I discover that the place is half empty and many rooms are vacant but requested the walk in rate close to a 100USD for 5 hours instead of the 50-60 online average. The other Sama hotel outside in the public zone requests a laughable high rate. This all was of no problem as KLIA2 (Low cost terminal) has been rebuild with a huge mall adjacent and the Kliaexpress train stops there and has 2 very reasonably priced hotels. However sadly last train service is midnight or 00.30. Kuala Lumpur airport around 2am and after is a sad sight. Many passengers sleeping where they can on the floor or benches. A gang (cannot think of a better name) of taxi drivers who ask 50 ringits (16USD) for the short drive to the other terminal. No shuttle bus to KLIA2 until 6.30 and all information simply pushed me towards the taxi drivers. Why is KLIA1 so inattentive and dismissive of passengers after midnight? If they offer their services to airlines landing that time then they have the responsibility of offering a shuttle to KLIA2 as many wanted to go there either to catch a flight or use hotel services. I felt total disregards as well as ambivalence towards me and many of my fellow passengers who were in the same situation. Otherwise clean food venues alright and prices manageable.",NA,NA,NA,2,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

We are queuing at the premier lane and it will probably take us 45 mins to clear immigration just in time to board the flight. We might have been in serious trouble if we would have had to use the regular immigration counters.

I would have to say that this would have to be the worst airline terminal that I have ever used. On arrival from Penang to KL the signage and directions were non existent to the point where half of the passengers on a local flight ended up in International Arrivals instead of Domestic Arrivals. A group of us were trying to get directions on how to get back to domestic and the ground staff were all but useless - usual advice received was just keep walking. The trouble was we did not even know if we were headed in the right direction. After finally sorting ourselves out I then proceeded to International Departures. I have to say that this terminal does not have one redeeming feature. I had a 4 hour wait - the food choices were poor and I asked if there was food once I checked through Customs and Immigration and was told no - so had something and then proceeded through Customs etc and then found that there were places to eat inside.

To be fair the airline has its own terminal so this review relates to that one. The Air Asia terminal has no transit facilities - so you need to enter Malaysia and then exit via Immigration. So be sure you have a visa if you need one. You can only check in for your continuing flight about 2 hours before departure and there are few facilities available before you get to the departure gates (after immigration). There are very few chairs and the crowds are huge so don't expect to find a place to sit. The air conditioning hardly works and KL is a hot tropical city. Its less comfortable than most Greyhound bus stops in the US in fact its the worst air terminal I have ever had to go through. Availability of food or drink in the check-in area is very limited. Bathrooms are dirty and several facilities are broken. This is an awful terminal in almost every respect - so I won't go on and on.

KLIA is far better than LCCT. Check-in was efficient and easy. The skytrain was good too. Overall the terminal is very clean and spacious. However there are a few issues/problems: The toilets/bathrooms are not clearly marked on the map. The lifts to the mezzanine level are too few and far away from the gates. Due to poor lift access the food outlets are difficult to access. The pricing of the food (compared to normal KL pricing of food) is expensive. I don't understand why there are 2 security scans. The first is simple and quick (no taking out laptops and jackets etc.) but the second is more thorough (take out laptops etc). They airport staff should warn passengers about this. Security/airport staff at the security check were not helpful and attentive. I had to wait some time for the security staff to take the box I used to scan my laptop. Once at the gate there is no clear signage clearly stating which one is the boarding gate.

Your duty free is delivered to you as you hand in your boarding passes when leaving. You wouldn't want to be stuck there with a delay. You are bussed to your aircraft and be prepared for a bumpy take off - the runway is very uneven.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport was modern but at the same time still very small - the baggage reclaim area was just a short walk away from the aircraft you could easily follow ramp activity and your luggage on its way from the aircraft through the large windows and you didn't have to wait long. There is a bus service to downtown Kosice but I don't think that they connect with arriving and departing flights - I took a taxi to my hotel instead. On the landside I noticed that - despite the size of the airport and the relatively small number of flights handled - the car rental desks were staffed (and not just equipped with a direct-dial phone to some downtown office or so).

krakow-airport,/airport-reviews/krakow-airport,Krakow Airport customer review,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,2013-01-02,Two recent domestic return flights from WAW. Domestic terminal is tiny and resembles the former Etiuda terminal at WAW. Baggage reclaim is rather slow. Check-in is surprisingly quick despite long queues. Security and ground staff are fine. The free bus from the railway station is timed to pick up arrivals but is not so useful when leaving the domestic terminal - the bus can wait for up to 30 minutes at the international terminal so it's sometimes quicker to walk. Facilities consist of two shops and a cafe with minimal seating before security - not a problem when the flight is on time but my second flight was delayed by two hours due to fog which made things less pleasant.

Just make sure you are in the right queue when they start check in as it is a complete scrum. They did put small signs up about 20 mins too late.

No one to point nor direct queues - it's a free-for - all particularly when it comes to a point that passengers are going to miss flights. We queued for nearly 1hr30 mins to be screened and as we neared the end more people just pushed past and jumped ahead. No staff whatsoever around to keep everything under control. On other occasions some staff did then seem to escort certain passengers to the front of the lines which is wrong when you have people queuing for ages. It's time the whole mess was sorted out.

There was no separate accomodation for Business or First Class at boarding and not even an announcement - everyone just headed for the door when it seemed ready to load.

Since I am a budgeting hound there's not much choice of airport when you locate a nice cheap airfare (sites like skyscanner or skypicker for this) but this is the least awful airport for those going in and out of NYC. The area is not good and its better to get a park and fly so your car will have the hotel security rather than leave your car at the airport.

Even walking to the baggage claim without bumping into other people is a challenge. No free wifi and only a few power ports can't even be a major concern in this airport as so many other things are just miserable. Total chaos continues landside where signage is insufficient and no one seems welcoming. Public transportation limited and reliable systems like rail links non-existent.

While it is convenient in that you go to just one place regardless of which company you use and there are then just two busses to choose from (depending on which terminal you are departing from) you have a long trip on the bus and need to allow for the extra time (and getting to the rental car facility by vehicle can be confusing since you do not take the same main road as to get to the airport terminal).

las-vegas-airport,/airport-reviews/las-vegas-airport,Las Vegas Airport customer review,John Oram,NA,2007-01-21,LAS is a popular international destination and has some catching up to do. International arrivals is not designed to cope with multiple arrivals and indeed these are scheduled separately. When we arrived on Maxjet we were on time and Virgin were late so their passengers were just ahead of us. Having said that every possible line was open and they were working pretty fast. The immigration official was even quite charming in a curmudgeonly sort of way. The Alamo shuttle was tardy. For departure T2 is not the place to be. Check-in was fine. Bad design means that the security line which was not actualy that long easily backs up on to the escalator which is potentially dangerous. TSA procedures border on the bizarre overkill but at least they are beginning to admit that. Through security facilities are absolutely minimal and as Maxjet don't yet have a lounge quite inadequate.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

At the northern end of the terminal are 12 checkin counters for Qantaslink Jetstar Virgin Blue and Tiger Airways which has created more room than before. Southern end of the terminal has two baggage carousels added with car rental counters opposite for Avis Budget Europcar Hertz Thrifty & Red Spot. New upgraded retail outlets are provided in the central section of the terminal which are Newslink Long Bar and Hudson's Coffee. This central area has been expanded with a greater amount of room making it easier when more than one flight is in at the same time. New security area directs passengers downstairs to new roomy departure lounges which are now at the lower level. Windows at the central section and the departure lounges give visitors and passengers great views of the mountains east of the airport.

Parking charges to simply drop someone off were introduced in 2011. With inflation currently running at 0% they've recently increased the charge by 50% to £3. Last year (2014) they increased the charge for large vehicles from £2 to £6. The surrounding roads are strictly no-parking and Police vehicles are strategically placed in high-profile locations to intimidate customers - a real warm Yorkshire welcome. No change is given for overpayments at the exit barriers if you don't happen to have the correct coins. If you want to use a luggage trolley that will cost you (non refundable). If you want a taxi you are forced to use the one and only over-priced taxi firm who have paid LBIA for the franchise and these must be pre-booked and paid for in cash (fees apply to debit and credit cards).

I have used LBA for departure twice recently with the new layout. At first the impression was a bit claustrophobic. I appreciated the new facilities. The idea of separate lounges (one for business one for leisure) is smart. I got a lot of work done on a 5 hrs delay and the £17 for 3 hours fare was well paid for. The small airport after the revamp has managed to squeeze in a lot of shops and cafes but still managed to preserve a small gathering area for each gate. The airport is obviously always busy and I can't imagine how it can be during peak holiday times. After security (pretty friendly and fast indeed) the hall is stretched to an almost single passageway. Getting a seat in the various cafes and fast-food places is a lottery. Even the spacious food court downstairs is always busy and pretty noisy.

As I drive a ford transit sized vehicle I could not get under the barrier to the cars only drop off and so had to drop my customers off in the minibus drop off area and was totally shocked to find I had to pay £6 to get out. People were driving up to the barriers and finding that they now needed more coins than expected and were reversing out to get change.

Everything about this airport appears to be designed to make things as awkward for pax as possible or to get them to spend as much money as possible. From the £2.00 drop-off charge to the poor pedestrian access to the long-stay car parks it's mostly bad. The airport had few arrivals at the time we landed yet it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive. On the return leg it took 25 minutes to check-in just 6 passengers in front of me then another 20 minutes to clear security. For an airport which only had 5 flights within the hour this is unacceptable. Airside is crowded and poorly-ventilated with lots of unpleasant drunken locals staggering around. Although the number of shops/restaurants is much better now this is at the expense of space. Seating is minimal unless you are willing to spend money to eat in the overpriced restaurants.

Now it's just another miserable big airport in miniature - all of the bad bits with none of the good bits. As other posters have noted the drop-off experience is ghastly and the £1 baggage trolley charge is crass. The former long stay car parking has suddenly been chopped in two. They made the half that's nearest the terminal into short stay. This bit is naturally deserted since LBA has almost zero business/short haul traffic. So you now walk miles across this empty car park before reaching the long stay somewhere near Horsforth. From here your long walk uphill back to the terminal is compounded by all the old entry doors being permanently locked since they now placed the main entrance at the far end of the terminal. Once inside of course they make you double back since security is back in the direction you came from. A good work out for such a tiny airport. Baggage handling can be lame. On my inbound flight when the bags emerged on the carousel they were from the wrong flight. Pax noted this staff did nothing. So staff were alerted who immediately went on the defensive and refused to help ""we don't know any more than you do"" etc. So we all stood and watched the same bags go round for maybe 20 minutes with no-one taking anything off. Because no bags were claimed there was no room to load any more of the right bags. So they just kept going round and round. Staff refused to take them off bizarrely insisting ""please remove your bag so we can make more space"". Hey they're the wrong bags we kept telling them. ""Don't get shirty with me it's not our fault"" etc. Meantime the other side of the curtain 4 baggage handlers sat around doing nothing with full carts that they could not load - stalemate. Eventually enterprising pax started pulling off the wrong bags manually to make the odd bit of space. At which point ground staff suddenly decide to confuse everyone by announcing ""if your bag has not arrived please come and fill in a form"". So now more mayhem as the pax try to ascertain ""did they not even load the bags at all?"" Reply - ""we don't know any more than you etc"" Meantime the odd correct bag suddenly starts appearing one at a time in the gaps created by the enterprising pax. An hour later eventually everyone got their bag one by one. By the way this was the only inbound flight in an otherwise deserted baggage hall. It really defies belief.

After years of construction everything appears to be complete. LIT is smoke free so smokers must cross security and go to a covered outside area. Several coffee shops and a mini food court were added however while several open early for early bird flights most close long before the last flights arrive. A couple of little news stands and a book store was added but the gift shop is not on the secure side. So if someone one that has a lay over must cross security to shop. Free wireless internet has be added that can be accessed from almost any where between gates 1 & 12. Overall not bad for a small airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

My wife and I have had 4 return flights via Liverpool this year and on each occasion we have encountered neither holdups nor unprofessionalism. It has rarely taken us travelling with hand luggage only more than 20 minutes from car park to departure lounge on the outward journey or from aircraft back to our car on the return journey. We have never experienced any unpleasantness from security staff: on our most recent transit my liquids bag was selected for testing but the lady who carried out the testing was extremely polite and even asked me first if I minded. Just as someone else has said earlier I regard the prime purpose of an airport as being to get me to or from my flight as quickly and painlessly as possible and LPL invariably succeeds on that basis. Although it has grown considerably since we first started to fly from there it is not so big or so busy as Manchester and for us that is a great advantage.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1

For me an airport's principal purpose is to facilitate my departure / arrival as painlessly as possible and LPL has largely done so each time I have used it this year. I have no problems with walking from the car park (instead of having to wait for a transfer bus as at some airports) and travelling hand luggage only have rarely spent more than half an hour getting from car park through to departure lounge. Passage through security has always been swift - but my wife and I are usually flying out first thing in the morning - and we have never encountered any lack of politeness perhaps because a smile and a ""Good morning"" from us creates a favourable ambience. Even when we had an item confiscated last week (a jar of jam - don't ask!) it was done in a perfectly pleasant way and demonstrated that the security staff were vigilant. I would agree that the carpeting throughout the terminal looks dowdy but I think that is due to an unfortunate choice of pattern / colour rather than actual dirtiness. Returning through LPL isn't the most exciting experience in the world especially if two flights arrive almost simultaneously but I have queued far longer at passport control in Spanish airports and had longer walks from plane to exit.

Security took me maybe 10 minutes and the people were pleasant. I also noticed them helping a man who was partly crippled with great kindness and courtesy. I had a very good breakfast at £12.50 but worth the extra for freshly prepared food proper waitress service and much better than awful self service ones where you get bacon that was cooked hours before and eggs swimming in grease.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Ed Smith,United Kingdom,2012-07-01,"I used Liverpool airport for the first time in a few years recently - I have to say the Departure experience has vastly improved - gone now is the terrible old slow security area that forced you to queue on the stairs or tried to blackmail you with a ""Priority Security Charge"" - the security area is now well staffed and you get through it quickly - plus the new route through departures takes you on a nice walk with good views across the airfield and the river. The departure area is well equipped with shops and cafes etc but still with plenty of waiting space and you don't have to walk far to the gates. I like the fact that they have a couple of bits of John Lennon memorabilia scattered about the place - I'd suggest that they acquire some more and turn it into a bit of a mini-museum - little things like that make a difference to an airport experience. Flying into the airport is still a bit rubbish though - you now have to walk along a long semi-exposed walkway through to the arrivals area which is fun when it's cold and wet - fine if you are travelling on your own but this must be an ordeal if you have young kids in tow. To be fair when I arrived baggage reclaim was quick as was passport control and I was in the arrivals area within about 10 mins of touchdown which really isn't bad. Parking fees are pretty steep at the airport - I'd suggest if you are getting collected the best thing would be for whoever is collecting you to wait in a side road and for you to phone them when you are about to go through customs then meet them in the ""drop off"" zone - you still only get 5 mins so you need to be quick (again probably not practical if you have kids in tow or have mobility problems).

On each occasion passage through Security has been swift and painless with staff efficient and polite even when one of us has been selected for extra scrutiny. Retail and food outlets do not interest us so we sit at the easyJet end of the building until our flight is called. I would agree however with some of the comments posted about the hold-ups to pass through passport control on returning to the UK - the immigration area is small and quickly becomes congested when 2 flights arrive in quick succession. It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level.

It's an absolute joke of a car park. Now the airport - it used to be good. It was a small well run and organised business. Now the owners have become ambitious expanded the building in a variety of wierd ways and it's a dog's dinner. Lifts constantly out of order escalators turned off security queues that have to be seen to be believed ludicrous routes to the gates that generally involves zig zagging through endless shops the gates themselves that haven't seen any investment since 1980 staff who have turned disinterested into an artform filthy toilets etc etc. Every cliche regarding a bad airport is captured in this terrible place.

Following recent surgery my wife temporarily needed wheelchair assistance and we could not fault the service provided. It was even thanks to LPL's e-mail passenger service system that I finally discovered how to contact easyJet to add a request for special assistance. We were directed to the PRM (Passengers of Reduced Mobility) desk when we arrived checked in there and were issued with a wheelchair and then allowed to make our own way through security to the gate. Security was very quiet but in any case we were directed straight to the nearest desk where everyone was very attentive and helpful. There were even apologies for the need to ""frisk"" my wife. We had to have a convoy system for boarding as there were 7 wheelchair passengers for the flight the other 6 of whom required the ""ambulift"" while my wife was able to climb the aircraft steps alone and at her own speed. The whole procedure went so smoothly that the flight actually was able to leave early. Our return was equally well handled: since an ambulift appeared at the side of the plane and there were only 2 PRM passengers this time it seemed churlish to turn it down so we were transported directly to passport control and bypassed the queues in the chicane.

E- Passport worked fine - fortunately it was a quiet time. I have a gripe about the lack of water fountains - luckily I had been able to refill my water bottle at Schiphol. I don't know if the airport wants to force to you pay for expensive bottle water or if its an oversight but please do something about it if you don't want to annoy your customers. I also found the passenger information in the South terminal confusing - screen give a check in location for each airline but I couldn't find anything to say if a given flight was operating on time or find any details of codeshares.

Our flight briefly appeared on the board that everyone was crowding around but then disappeared never to be seen again. A crate of water was then distributed by Gatwick staff and odd messages were announced over the tanoy regarding the apology of Swissport to be able to deliver our bags. The whole thing was a shambles and a disgrace to Gatwick even if it was not there fault. Gatwick should handle all of these matters and not rely on third party companies who do not employ enough staff to handle the scheduled flights - the flights are not a surprise after all!

Amazing congestion. Were they never expecting any one to use it? Did they not anticipate that people might have luggage. Shuttle to North terminal quick and efficient. Emirates lounge does not give access to Qantas Club passengers even though they've paid for lounge access. (This is an emirates issue not a Gatwick issue - though it does make the whole experience seem cheap. There is lounge access for example at Heathrow.)

Both of terminals are in good condition and under the new ownership is being improved very fast and effectively. Check In and Security is fast most of the time. There seems to be more shops and better restaurants in the North Terminal which is bigger but the South is becoming just as good. One thing is that gates do take a good amount of time to come on screen but they are never far away. Boarding is always doing using a Jetway. On arrival deboarding is speedy and takes you straight to immigration. The wait generally is no longer than 10 mins and with the new e booths it is getting quicker. Baggage reclaim can take some time but where doesn't really? Not to mention the cleanliness it is very impressive!

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2013-06-11,Since London Gatwick is the furthest London airport from where I live I don't tend to use it too often. Living north of London it involves a long trek down the M1 and M25 both frequently congested so in my case not a good route to get there. I find the North Terminal to be much better than the South generally since its more modern and much cleaner with shorter queues however I do find there's a better range of shops and facilities in the South Terminal. Overall the airport experience is ok but areas can be very busy at times and gates can be quite a walk (but walking over the sky bridge at the North Terminal is fantastic). Arriving was less easy. We had to all squeeze into a bus and be transferred to arrivals where passport control was still a bit of a walk. It's ok at a regional airport but this is not the sort of arrival I would expect at a major airport like London Gatwick. Whilst the airport has vastly improved since BAA's ownership I would still be pleased to see a bit more sparkle and a bit more of an international airport feeling rather than an inner city shopping centre. I think the absence of flight announcements gives this feeling and also is rather irritating as you have to keep checking the screens regularly. Overall I would say Gatwick is a little disappointing for it's size and importance as a major UK airport. It offers a smooth enough journey and I would never advise people to avoid London Gatwick but I would rarely recommend it out of choice.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The entire airport particularly the interior of the South terminal is old and dirty with some general dirt and litter around. Both before and after security as well as near arrivals consists of an adequate amount and variety of shops food outlets restaurants with the addition of many other facilities but for an airport of that size I expected much more. Queues are always a big problem with check-in rarely being quicker than 15 or 20 mins security up to 30 mins and passport control normally taking at least 10 or 15 mins.

There is substantial North Terminal refurbishment underway focused it seems on the car parks. I hope it is worth their while. Gatwick has probably suffered more then most over the years from the vagaries of the airline industry as Laker Dan-Air and Air Europe all disappeared and BA have had an increasingly fluid approach to their routes and operations there. Security was swift and painless and I think overall that the new owners are making an effort to improve the airport.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Roger Smith,United Kingdom,2010-07-18,I have been using Gatwick Airport since 1963. During that time I have seen it change from a pleasant and small airport used primarily by charter airlines into the nightmare that it is today. During the 1980's I would regularly leave a Scottish airport on time only to spend an hour or so circling over Gatwick due to congestion on the one runway. Departing from the airport today it is obvious that enormous sums of money have been invested into the shopping mall that you are faced with following the security bottle-neck. On arrival however it is a very different matter an assault course is the first welcome to the incoming passenger who is then faced with passport controls that operate in a building site that seems to have remained in the same state for about 10-years floors walls and ceilings all in a state of mess as is the baggage collection area that is designed to create a bottle-neck of passengers blocking the flow from many flights who are trying to find where their baggage will be dumped. A special innovation nowadays is the need for passengers to be in possession of either a euro or one-pound coin for use of a baggage trolley specially helpful for anyone arriving from outside the EC.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

On departure the check-in area is large and spacious like the old T1 its on a level up from roadside so you approach via an elevated road. Once through security (no problems there with the staff) there are enough seats for everyone. My main gripe is the place lacks that certain atmosphere the old T2 had. It all seemed a bit too new and sterile. Walking under the aircraft parking area to get to the departure gate was a little annoying but moving walkways help. On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks.

They do not have a proper transit system in operation and you must go through passport control and bag screening even if you are just connecting to another flight.

At bag control they merged transit passengers with new passengers making lines very long. We had over an hour and just made our flight but our bags did not and many passengers missed flights.

Arrived terminal 1 12/08/2014. Arrived at T2 over 3 hours before departure. Good signage to indicate check in zones. Check-in for Star Alliance flights is generic and the entire process was chaotic with passengers about to miss their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to a check-in desk. Despite it being the 1st week of school summer holidays and 5 Star Alliance flights checking-in simultaneously not all check-in desks were manned. Check in staff were minimally communicative. Eventually got checked in then came the security 'experience'. Long queues for security. My cabin bag was selected for further checks which required a further long wait as there were several bags selected for further checks and just 1 member of staff doing this - in the 1st week of school summer holidays! The additional security checks on my back-pack must have taken about 40 minutes by the time the 1 member of staff got to my bag had checked everything swabbed everything put the swab through the ionmiser re-xrayed everything and then I had to re-pack everything. Eventually completed security clearance had a quick trip to the toilets (clean) and got to departure gate with about 10 minutes to spare. At departure gate a sullen non-communicative member of ground handling staff. Airbridge was broken so down two flights of stairs and walk to aircraft. On arrival on 12/08 after spending an extraordinary amount of time going around in circles above London we eventually landed followed by a very long taxi to airbridge. Good signage in terminal. Clean and plentiful toilets. Very long walk to T1 UK border from where aircraft parked. Reasonable queues at UK border handled by pleasant UK border staff. Baggage reclaim no problems as baggage already on carousel when we got there. The final insult: sitting in the grid-locked traffic at about 22:45 outside of T1 car park for about 15 minutes wondering why we're not moving.

Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers.

Arriving is not so good with lengthy queues for passport checks as others have mentioned the scanners are painfully slow. Buses to and from long stay car parks seem to work well. My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,C Brown,United Kingdom,2014-04-11,Having read some of the reviews for Heathrow Airport one could be left thinking that the UK's hub airport is a third world disgrace. My experiences however are quite the opposite. I've flown from LHR a few times over the last couple of years and my last trip was to and from Terminal 5 in April 2014. The terminal building is light airy and clean. Everything is well sign-posted and there's a good choice of landslide coffee shops restaurants and pubs. Along with a pharmacy bureaux de change and other amenities. Although there are plenty of staff on hand I would say that the queuing system for check-in needs an overhaul. Despite being able to check-in at any desk one is left to queue at each desk individually; if a problem arises with a passenger in front then you are stuck waiting for that check-in agent whilst other passengers on surrounding desks move to the front. Despite some reviews I have always found the security process through to the departures lounge to be very quick and professional. On my latest trip I waited around 30 seconds. You can tell that the airport authority has invested a lot of money on the screening equipment used. I don't know whether some passengers aren't used to stringent security but I feel reassured and have never encountered a rude member of security staff. In fact I've found them to be both approachable and friendly. Terminal 5 is a giant shopping mall it has to be said - and an expensive one at that. But the fantastic panoramic views and beautiful sunlight coming through the expansive windows is enough to compensate for the commercialism. There's a good choice of bars and eateries. Unlike some other terminals at Heathrow you don't have to walk nearly as far to get to your gate but be warned - If you are travelling from gates marked 'B' or 'C' then you have to get an underground shuttle train to a satellite terminal and this can take 15 minutes. On arrival back to the UK I was through immigration in a couple of minutes and had my luggage a few minutes after that.

Once airside there were plenty of seats notably at the Crown Rivers pub which has expanded its seating and provides a perfect place to nurse a pint or two whilst waiting for one's departure gate to be posted and the Scotch whisky selection at the various duty free shops is as good as it's ever been.

As on previous occasions at T1 I found the security staff to be officious slow and apparently unconcerned about people missing their flights. There was no fast track lane or help for those with tight connections.

When assistance staff arrived he refused to speak to me talking only to the aircrew and referring to me as ""she"" - he put me on the bus to T3 with my luggage and had a furious row with the bus driver who told me I should have been accompanied - the driver and another passenger kindly helped me to the assistance desk at the other end (not his job at all).

Many bags were being lined up for a hand inspection with only one person checking them. Most bags had nothing in them to be removed. I was in a crowd of people waiting for my bag for 25 mins! While one lady slowly checked one thing at a time. Laughing and talking to her colleagues. There was no urgency despite the fact that I said my flight was boarding in 10 mins. I was bomb checked twice because they had nothing better to do. My bag was in a line of about 12-15 bags just sitting there while I waited. 7 people had to have suitcases offloaded from our flight too which delayed us.

This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport.

Nasty cramped dirty and poorly laid out waiting area for the departure gates at terminal 3 which has only wildly overpriced junk food available to eat. The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed.

In most respects the airport is fine and in particular departure security queues are much quicker than a few years ago. The problem is immigration control. On one occasion the queues were bad on the other appalling - even for EU passport holders. Lots of desks were unstaffed and the queue for the new e-passport gates seems to take even longer than the queue for the staffed desks.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,Bill Atkins,United States,2012-02-27,T5 has great potential to be world-class but does not deliver it due to poor planning. The whole transfer process needs to be rethought. There is too much waiting in line for the various boarding pass/passport procedures - more agents needed. Transfer security screening is the same nightmare it was in the old BA multi-terminal days. Many lines of passengers trying to merge then capacity controls on the escalator as there is a huge bottleneck at the top of it. Nothing good can be said of the screening area and staff though I feel sure they are grumpy and aggressive for the same reason the passengers are.

T5 is by far the best and despite its size it feels quite relaxed and human. I had no problem with queues except at immigration and even those were not too bad. The only downside appears to be that it can be a very long time between leaving the gate and taking off I think it was about 20 minutes for a 45 minute flight to Brussels. T1 is not too bad though it feels like a crowded shopping mall but there are quieter places to sit the waiting areas at the departure gates are rather depressing. Queues for security and immigration were both fairly lengthy. T3 for check-in and arrivals last week was quite good but once in the departure area it is an unpleasant environment: crowded with insufficient seating and no view. Security was efficient and with a chipped passport I got through immigration quickly.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,G Calafiore,Australia,2011-07-10,You really have to consider LHR as 4 separate airports according to which terminal you use. Arrival from JFK at T5; and absolute joy. Clean bright terminal with plenty of space and well-laid out. UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy. I always go through late enough to have my gate number posted on the FID's and head straight there and it's usually fairly painless.

Also the entire experience is one giant queue. Queue for check in, queue for security, queue to get through the narrow maze path
that is the new duty-free, then finally end up in an open space to be greeting by a refugee camp scene. No Seats - probably to force you to shop even more. Again, what are people with disabilities of mobility issues supposed to do here? You then queue for an escalator down to a pier, then queue for the toilets (mens). On your way in you queue for ages and ages to get through passport control. Clearly this airport hates its customers.

The Check-in area is a bit smaller now to make way for expansion in Security and Departures but was always too big for it's own good anyway so not a problem. The new Security area is much improved from the old one not only quicker and less stressful but bright and airy. Departures is a little bit cramped at busier times but looking forward to the first phase of it's expansion opening this summer allowing for more shops restaurants and more seating areas. Have always liked the Satellite buildings where the gates are at Stansted more peaceful than the main Departure lounge with great views across the airport if you like that kind of thing. Sometimes there's a bit of a walk to and from the gates but not as bad as some airports. Arrivals is generally ok although they could do with expanding and improving the Passport Control area. The baggage reclaim area is spacious and usually very quick and easy to get through. There is generally a good spread of facilities such as toilets currency exchange shops restaurants and so on throughout the entire airport. In terms of getting to and from Stansted the train isn't the quickest in the world at 45 minutes to Central London but is literally downstairs beneath the Terminal which is ideal when travelling with luggage. Lots of Car hire companies as well as a taxi transfers can be found in the Arrivals area plus there's also lots of bus and coach services.

There has been a huge improvement in Security and although the queue's sometimes look horrendous they actually move quite quickly. The longest I have had to wait is 20 minutes through Security but that was at the start of a bank holiday. Most of the time I get to the airport an hour before the flight and wonder what the rush was all about. Security usually takes 5-10 minutes 15 minutes max. Passport control is usually fairly rapid although it was extremely busy around two weeks ago which I didn't expect turning up on a Monday night at 11pm. That being said it was the end of a bank holiday and was caused be sheer volume of people more than anything else. What can you do! To be fair all 25 or so security desks were staffed and the queue looked worse than it was. 20 minutes it took to get through. It looked more like 2 hours from the back! Still there were a lot of people complaining. I guess most people haven't got any tolerance for slight delay these days and expect everything to happen instantly! I suppose what the staff should have done on that occasion is reassure people at the back that the wait is only 20 minutes as it really did look like we would be there all night causing people to get agitated and stressed. Living in Cambridge I find the airport highly accessible. 30 minutes drive down a motorway with easy car parks or 30 minute direct train straight into the terminal.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,R Fry,United Kingdom,2013-09-25,It is a disgrace that the new owners of Stansted have managed to turn what was a well run pleasant to use airport into a nightmare. Until recently if you arrived by taxi or were dropped off by a friend it was outside the doors to the booking in desks. Now you have to pay to be dropped off at a ridiculously crowded area and push your cases up a steep ramp which is very unpleasant when you get to your 70s. And if the traffic queues are long you have to pay more for the pleasure of sitting in the queue to be dropped off. Coming back is just as bad controlling a trolley going down a steep ramp is very unpleasant and then you have the problem of locating your lift back home - a mobile phone is essential to find out where to go. After getting to the check in area for some reason or other the time to check in or drop your bags off takes a lot longer despite arriving 3 or more hours before take off. Then as has been mentioned by others there is the very long delays (almost an hour on our last trip) getting through security with rude staff constantly trying to push you through. Again a horrible experience when you are travelling with a family from 4 years old to the over 70s - alternatively of course you could pay (a rip off £35 in our case) to use the priority security gates. As has been mentioned in other posts coming back the queues for passport control are very long and the last thing you want to encounter after a long flight with very tired children. We won't be using Stansted again until they have made substantial improvements - despite being 40 miles further to Gatwick the time to get from home to the plane will be a lot less and much less stressful.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Flying into it was good. No issues and the busses are a very short walk from the terminal. The issue with this airport is departures. We arrived back on our bus went to drop our bag and were greeted with a very long line for bag drop. We had pre- booked fast track security after reading some of the reviews on this site and we were glad we did that. Once though security is where our main issue with this airport started. We had 2 hours to wait and there was not enough seats for everyone who was there. The departures lounge was dirty too. The bar had no seats and when you did find one the table still had the previous guests trash on them. Also getting in and out of London takes a very long time from Stansted.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,V Brown,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers.

The experience itself is alright but there's no 'wow factor'. What Stansted really does need is a greater mix of airlines especially to long haul destinations such as New York or Dubai as there are currently no long haul flights from Stansted. Once services like these are introduced this will save many passengers having to use the busier congested airports like Heathrow and Gatwick. Furthermore we tend to travel to Romania frequently and it would be good to see carriers like Wizz Air introduce a Stansted-Bucharest service which would save us the hassle of using Luton airport. Clearly Stansted has a lot of potential to attract future long haul growth and new airlines besides Ryanair.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2013-06-09,I use London Stansted frequently since I find it by far the best of London's airports or indeed the UK. It is significantly busier departing in the morning and arriving in the evening yet the airport still maintains its level of great customer service. This is through consistently having short queuing times at check-in security and passport control as well the provision of a wide range of shops restaurants food and drink outlets throughout the airport plus a wide range of other useful facilities. Flight information screens are very clear and easy to follow and are closely located to all areas whilst staff are also very friendly and helpful making the airport even more stress free. Without fail the terminal is always immaculately clean and still remains fairly spacious as airports go at the busiest of times. Public transport to the airport is good but could be better. Rail services are regular and run directly from the Terminal Building but 45-50 minutes into London is a little long. Road access however is great as the M11 and A120 is always a breeze of a journey and rarely congested unlike the M1 and M25 serving other London airports.

For a first timer you will need to keep your wits about you. After collecting your bags you face a very very long trip to retrieve your car from the Long stay. Expect your wife and kids to wait a good 45 minutes for you to return. The problem is the pick up point is effectively outdoors and your companions may freeze to death waiting for you. But if they wait in the terminal how are you going to find each other once you return etc.? In practice you have to negotiate some confusing signage to find the 15 minute pick up zone amongst many similar zones. Choose the wrong one and you've got another lap to do. Once parked sprint as fast as you can to find your companions in the airport - the clock is ticking. Sprint back down again with all your trolleys then the next challenge is to find your car. Stansted offers you a number of exit points all designed identically and impossible to distinguish from each other. You will come out at the wrong one the coaches Zone XX eventually you find your car. Load up as fast as you can and sprint back to the ticket machine before the 15 minutes expires.

Big, messy, badly signposted and facilities are almost non-excistant. Nevermind the shopping, but it would be nice to have a decent meal. Terminal 4 restaurants were small, way too full and awfully noisy. There was 25 minute wait at the pizza place. Food was overly expensive compared to the quality and portion size. There wasn't enought seats at the gate. To be precise there wasn't enough room anywhere. There was no place to relax and chill out before being stuck on the plane for hours.

Sad to say LAX struck out badly. Entered Passport Control area around noontime, there were people in red uniforms directing USA travelers to the automated passport kiosks. Another person in a red uniform said many of the kiosks in this row were down. So why didn't the person directing me to use them know this? An utter fiasco. As I left to the real person passport check line, people in red were arguing among themselves as to which machines were working, which were not.  Went downstairs to baggage claim and another fiasco. Baggage carousels had signage showing all the arriving international flights, but no information as to which carousel to go for your flight's baggage. Master baggage carousel sign on the wall listed all the flights. Again no information as to which carousel to use. Over the PA system, a hard to hear voice gave out the information on where to go for your baggage. No information saying area was being upgraded, work in progress or under repair. Or is this just the daily standard for LAX? Went to my terminal gate for connecting flight. Saw a snack area offering small, thin sandwiches and drinks.  I guessed an overpriced $5-6 for one.  I about choked when I was told they sell for over $11 each. Funny how retail stores must have a price shown for every item while LAX hasn't got a clue. I have to give LAX credit for the connecting flight baggage handling drop-off as you leave the International area. Finally an efficient area with someone in charge who knows how to do their job.

I flew into and out of here on VX and also flew to SIN lucky for me I had laid over three days on the outbound and two days on the inbound for if I was connecting I'd recommend at least 3-4 hours minimum as signage for connecting flights is lacking. The food options are surprisingly limited for such a busy airport even SFO puts this place to shame in that department though no U.S. airport could really hope to compete with Singapore Changi. Returning to the U.S.it took forever to clear immigration and customs with a few A380s arriving simultaneously you'd think the powers that be would have considered this when they were bringing those big planes in.

We arrived from Las Vegas to connect to a flight to Europe and not knowing LAX at all were a bit surprised that there was no ongoing flight information for flights outside of Terminal 4. We looked in vain for an information desk of any kind in Terminal 4 and so found ourselves heading to Terminal 5 hoping to find one there. Was a little surprised that an airport of this size an importance relied on its passengers walking down claustrophobic tunnels between terminals with no transport or moving walkways but put this down to the redevelopment going on. Once in Terminal 5 it took another round of searching for an info desk (with our flight departure time getting ever closer) to eventually find one tucked away in a corner. The patronising attendant told us that we needed the Tom Bradley Terminal which was two terminals along and waved in the vague direction of a corridor which led who knows where. The corridor eventually led outside where we would have hoped to find a map or some form of signage to the terminal. Nothing of the kind could be seen. We ended up asking a shuttle bus attendant for directions after which we walked for 10 minutes to eventually find the right place. We are not stupid people and do not get overly stressed but it was a good job that we had a three hour connection time as anyone with a short interval between flights would have missed by a mile.

Unacceptable by any standards of a major international airport to process passengers from 1 plane from 1 flight for 1 hour and 48 minutes stuck in a underground bunker room with no windows. Over staffed everywhere but activities duplicated extending the time needed and causing chaos. Manual punching info in so many computers. Departure is crowded security checks are strict but completely disorganized. Generally very surprised on the low comfort levels in US airports in my 3 weeks tour around the States.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Raven,Canada,2013-10-22,An atrocious place to transfer between international flights. Also dingy understaffed and too small for the volume of passengers moving through. City and/or state and/or national authorities should be embarrassed by this place which is the first glimpse of many visitors. I understand that American airports have no concept of passengers in transit but LAX makes transferring especially tedious. On my last trip my 747 from Australia dumped its load into a Border Security hall that had only 6 agents working and which looked like the basement of a community centre. It took me 45 minutes to get through. Half the people in the line were panicking due to tight connections. After getting through the border (after which I was just going to be getting on a flight to another country anyway) I had to retrieve my bag go through another passport and bag check and then recheck the bag with United personnel who were behaving as if this was the first time they had done this. Next I had to find out where my next flight departed from. This was very difficult because the departure board in each terminal only shows the flights that depart from that terminal. So I had to ask an off-duty employee to point me in the general direction - which turned out to be the terminal farthest from my current location of course. Next I had to find my way with bags in tow from Terminal 7 to Terminal 2 (even though both airlines were Star Alliance partners). To make this journey one has three options: take a shuttle bus that circulates between the terminals walk the long long way around the horseshoe-shaped road or cut across the horseshoe on foot. Mindful of my short connection time I chose the latter. But the airport does not make it easy. Traffic is heavy there are no guiding signs and crosswalks are few. But I made it. Then I went through security all over again. Having started out with a 3-hour layover I made it to the gate 30 minutes before boarding. Well done LAX. Compare this to my experience in at least 3 other international non-American airports: got off plane looked at departure board for the gate for my next flight walk to that gate wait get on plane for a destination in another country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

After checking in the queue through security is horrendous typically 30 to 45 minutes. The TSA agents are rude (as they are at all American airports). The international dining area does not have enough seating. When returning to LAX from flights overseas you are again waiting in long queues. Immigration wait time is ok. However after picking up baggage everyone is funnelled into one queue to exit the baggage claim (sometimes there are 2 queues). For domestic flights routinely the wait to go through security is horrendous with too many TSA agents. Very rude very slow very inefficient. Routinely at terminal 1 and 2 the queues extend out into the street while waiting to get through security. As an American I am ashamed that we are a first world country with a third world airport. Parking is atrocious. Not enough parking in the international terminal parking structures. also expect to wait 20 minutes to 1 hour in the parking exit queue.

It's as if someone turned a functioning airport and flipped it upside down then turned it in side out. Terminal concourses that are 4 stories high with no sky bridges for planes like the 737 and A-319. This means walking down 4 flights of stairs to get to the tarmac then climb back up stairs to get onto the airplane. I wasn't even mad I was dumbfounded. I really couldn't believe what I was seeing which made me chuckle a bit. Just to hammer the point home said concourses were extremely narrow and lacked any visible seating so it was standing room only until the plane was ready to board. I've only flown out the once so I don't know if this is just one terminal and concourse leg or an example of the entire airport.

How can it possibly take so long to get from the plane when it is such a short distance to the terminal. This is not the longest wait we have had for luggage at Luton we waited 2 hours the last time we used the airport.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2014-06-12,Arguably one of the most dysfunctional airports I have ever been to. Just getting there is a nightmare with constant road works right from the M1. Plus unlike every other London airport the train station is a 10 minutes bus journey away so you have to hang around waiting and trudge on and off busses and trains which are unreliable to say the least and not ideal with 20kg of luggage. The Terminal itself is a dark gloomy and dirty congested dump. Queues to Security are a joke with some passengers even backing onto the stairs and staff didn't make the process any better. Departures is fractionally better in terms of light but was cramped nowhere to sit shops and restaurants packed out lack of shops and restaurants toilets in bad condition and generally too hot and stuffy. When it came to boarding we were held in a narrow stairwell for 20 minutes which is unacceptable. Arrival was slightly better but still not good enough taking well over an hour from disembarking to walking outside the Terminal. The airport is just too small for how many passengers it handles and they want to expand from 10 to 18 million passengers a year with just a few extra Security lanes shops seating areas and a new car park? A place to always steer clear of I think.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

When I asked why every other airport I have travelled through (10-15) accepts them I was given no explanation. It was re stated that I need to spend money buying their bags. When through in departures it is even more evident that the capacity is simply not enough the number of passengers. Despite being very early every shop cafe and seating area was overwhelmed.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-10,Having recently used this airport it is clearly evident that it is mainly geared towards low cost flights. The check in area is in desperate need of re-organisation (lots of confused passengers too few check in desks open and under staffed) results in huge crowds all confined in one small space with the other half of the check in hall being empty and unused. On a plus side going through security was quick and well organised. The departure lounge itself was alright with a good variety of (over priced) shops and restaurants. However the boarding system and gate area at Luton seriously needs to be improved; you are forced to shove for a place in the line and then be prepared to wait for a plane that hasn't even landed yet. Furthermore there is absolutely nowhere to sit down in the gate area which could be a problem for families with young children. Furthermore none of Luton's gates are fitted with jet bridges like Stansted so bring a coat with you in case it rains! On return we had to wait for over an hour for our suit case which is unacceptable. They kept stopping and restarting the conveyor (You'd think it would've just been easier to move the luggage onto a conveyor that actually worked properly!).

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2013-06-10,Luton is probably the worst of the London airports in my view yet it still has its good point and I have been to far worse airports before. The biggest problem is getting there. Whilst rail services to Luton Airport Parkway are very quick and regular Luton is the only London airport to have no on site railway station and therefore requites a shuttle bus ride to/from the terminal and that can really slow things down. The drive to the terminal from the M1 motorway J10 is atrocious and frequently congested. Speaking of congestion the airport terminal gets very busy in the morning and I believe nearly half the days departures leave before 9am. The relatively compact airport can get very busy in the morning period and queue times reflect this. We had to queue for a good 20 minutes to reach security which is significantly longer than at Stansted or even Heathrow T3. On the plus side the airport is very nice if flying after 9am where queues are shorter (but still could be better) and the departure lounge is bright and spacious. There's not as good a range of facilities like shops or restaurants as other London airports but it's still not bad considering the size of the airport and you do have everything you want or need before you fly. I have also never experienced poor service from staff although I have never had the misfortune to experience it really at any airport. One thing about Luton is that I can't really see it changing or improving much in the short to medium term as it's always very samey. Overall I would not recommend this airport out of choice however I would never really advise people to avoid it either. Just use it if you have to or it's easier for your journey.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

There is never seating room in the check in area. There is a rip-off fee for 'Priority' security a distance of some 10 metres and a possible time saving of 15 minutes another rip-off scam based on the exact size and the type of fastening of clear plastic bags required for liquids. In the past year there has been a distinct improvement in the politeness and care of the security search staff but you can still be bawled at or humiliated in front of other passengers. The amount of seating in the airport 'lounge' has been reduced (area taken over by Pret a Manger and other cafés). After boarding clearance has begun the holding areas are cramped and are often simply stark staircases. On return I have found the automatic passport gates (installed at enormous cost to the tax-payer) open just 7 times out of the hundreds (see above) of times I have travelled whilst staff actually manually checking passports are always too few while colleagues stand idly by.

There seems to be a massive lack of check in space with spiralling queues and airline staff struggling to keep queues and check-in under control. Sprinkler system activated and leaking water all over emergency doors in departures. Food outlets over-priced and food poor quality. Security queue an absolute disgrace in terms of amount of time you are expected to wait. I refuse to pay for the express service - you should not have to wait more than 15 minutes regardless of whether you pay extra. Many of us waited over 40 minutes in the normal security line. Airline staff constantly having to shout out flight numbers so certain passengers could be brought to the front of the queue to ensure that they don't miss their flight.

You can wait at the medium term car park for free for the first half hour. Absolute rip off and un-necessary worry when trying to pick up somebody.

The roundabout heading into the airport was chaos with cars from another direction trying to join the queue to the airport drop off zone. At this point it was a complete bottleneck. All of this is caused by a planning nightmare. Only two small drop off areas are open. There is an other area set aside for customers who have pre-booked but I guess even they have to queue to get in. The two lanes open only have spaces for only about 40 cars and cannot cope with the number of cars arriving and you are charge a Â£1 even if you are there 10secs. A third area remained closed with a barrier down. Finally some planner has had the brilliant idea of making the outward traffic cross the incoming traffic and has put traffic lights to delay things further. I can only say I found Luton ran smoother when there was a bigger temporary drop off area which was free and the whole place had miles of traffic cones going into the airport.

This includes trips up and down about 20 escalators for no good reason. It also includes a trip on an underground railway between immigration and baggage claim this is very disconcerting as the signage is not clear enough to explain that you will still get to your bags. After the train ride you still have to wait another 20 mins for your bags. 2) The signage is comedy - a down arrow actually means carry on rather than go down. This includes signs in front of the lifts - a down arrow means you actually need to go up! The gates are also lettered S R J and H. 3) The gate numbers are in the opposite order to what you expect with the lowest number gates often being the furthest away from you. 4) The airport is huge and you need to set off about 4 hours before boarding to allow for getting lost and working out what the signs mean! 5) All staff work at about the same speed as tectonic plate movements. Fast food is not fast food in Spain. 6) Check in was a joke. You can't use your online boarding pass without getting a ticket for your luggage from one of the automated tills but of course that wont read your passport so you have to go to a totally different set of desks instead! 7) The lady checking boarding passes was having a competition with herself to see how long she could take to check each document. Avoid the airport at all costs if you value your sanity.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,G Burns,United States,2013-06-13,Flew from Terminal 1 (on United to EWR). I was surprised to see the negative reviews; my own experience was very positive overall. First car rental drop off is very convenient right at the terminal no shuttle bus needed. (But be aware if you have a morning flight that I experienced pretty awful weekday Madrid rush hour traffic.) It's true that Section A gates are a fairly long walk but free luggage carts are provided after security and unlike so many US airports there was plenty of (attractive) seating at the gates.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Simon Smith,United Kingdom,2013-04-04,I use T4/T4S reasonably regularly. Overall the facilities are good and the airport is clean. There also generally isn't much of a queue for or immigration on arrival. Immigration on departure can be slower but additional staff seem to appear when a queue builds up. There are 2 main issues though. Baggage reclaim at T4 is always very slow - last time the bags took 45 minutes to arrive even though we landed off peak when there were hardly any other flights. I don't know how they manage to make it so slow. Also don't plan on shopping for anything practical a traveller might want - there are lots of shops selling expensive branded clothes and luxury products but it's difficult to find somewhere to buy a newspaper and there's nothing useful air-side like a chemist (it would be good to have a branch of Boots or something similar).,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Because of the completion of T3 has not been the best airport to visit but was hoping this year would be better in fact now worse. Fortunately Jet2 our carrier now has T3 booking desks from T1 and T2 previously however those with t1 or T2 desks have a long walk to the only customs in T3. On arrival last year we arrived T2 and went straight to the luggage belts in T2 this year arrived T2 and like 2011 had to walk through T3 and back to T2 luggage belts why I ask not good for us oldies. On departure things getting worse in October all the tables behind the x-ray machines have been removed which forces people to empty their trays of wallets etc whilst it is on the machines rollers still. This slow the passage of the bags etc to nearly a standstill we were moved to an x-ray machine with only 4 people in front of us with plastic trays but a full belt and a whole family of 4 trying to recover their items of the belt. 30 minutes later we got to put our trays through the machine. As I had to take my shoes and belt off I am trying to balance on one leg to get my shoes on whilst my partner stops our trays falling off. Once again they stop the belt and we delay for at least 5 minutes whilst we put shoes belts watches on as no where to put our trays. Having checked on line knew zone B but still a long walk to get there to find since May they have stripped out most of the seats near the boarding gates and now about 20 seats at each gate we arrived an hour before boarding all seats full just after our arrival.

For some reason however no details were being released about gates for flights not even which zone until actual boarding began.

It's big impressive and airy but there are still irritating niggles. On arrival we needed to go up to departures level to access our bus but couldn't find any way to do so apart from squeezing through barriers. We then unknowingly walked past the bus point because the signage was not displayed for passengers emerging from the terminal. We were glad that our car hire collection point was off-site as the area outside the airport was very congested. On our return we found Security somewhat disorganised. There was something of a melee to secure trays and at our security gate one harassed female agent seemed to be trying to do everything: call passengers through check the detector and frisk selected individuals whilst at the same time trying to call to a colleague to come and help. We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates. This time we were departing from Area C and our flight to Liverpool was announced early: all we heard was something about Liverpool so we followed others who started moving to join a queue.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,T Hamilton,United Kingdom,2015-02-12,"First the good: security lines are generally shorter for frequent flyers which is a definite plus during holiday season when the airport can fill with not the most savvy travel set. The T3 Escape Lounge is adequate even nice given how busy and cramped that terminal is. Emirates Lounge Virgin Lounge are both excellent. Airport shopping is decidedly down-market which I think is pretty nice (how many Mont Blanc pens does one need?) Having both Boots and WH Smith available is great. There is a train station at the airport too which is great (it's a nice little station but it does get busy.) Since it goes directly to Manchester Piccadilly you can pretty much get anywhere (relatively) directly from MAN via train. For the most part service is good at MAN. Immigration officials have always been courteous and professional with me. Now the bad: 1. Even in the ""Fast Lanes"" security is very slow. If you are unfortunate enough to have your bag separated for extra screening the process is excruciatingly slow. This happens to me about one in three trips. Be early. For some reason Manchester uses lots of employees to board a plane the security questions no one in the world continues to ask are asked twice if you are on a direct to the US. I at one time thought this was a US thing but it isn't it's a Manchester thing (the same thing does not happen in London Paris or Amsterdam for instance.) 2. The airport layout is nonsensical. There is this weird airport wide prohibition of ANY luggage on the escalators. They put up quite elaborate gates to prevent you from using the escalators with say a roller board (you are instructed to use the lifts.) Everyone ignores this stupid prohibition which I have never seen anywhere else in the world (30 countries hundreds of airports.) It's weird. 3. Taxi pickup is unnecessarily burdensome for both passenger and driver. In Terminal 2 for instance savvy drivers will pull up to passenger drop off to pick you up. 4. Arriving in Manchester can be hit and miss. Sometimes it is great for non-EU passport travellers like me (they are separated from EU passengers regardless of residency.) Sometimes it is horrendous. The immigration officers are typically very nice however. Speaking of if you arrive in Terminal 3 and need to get to the train fast avoid the lifts that take you to the parking garage. Instead follow the path from Terminal three and when you just arrive at Terminal 1 take the two small elevators to ""Terminal One Departures."" Enter the departure hall and ignoring the bags on escalator prohibition take the small escalators and you will be in the sky bridge to the train station. You can easily save five minutes getting to the station which if you are late can mean the difference between getting and missing a train. Terminal One is by far the nicest terminal three is a bit shabby and two is crowded (and also shabby.) Because the boarding areas are so poorly designed (meaning without any effort to facilitate people actually boarding airplanes) this is one airport that being a frequent flyer is a real plus. Being in the NW and without another international option MAN is my home airport. If I get through it hassle-free that's the best I can expect. At least I can take comfort that upon arrival I am almost home. The train is a real plus too.

Cigarette butts everywhere litter ingrained old dirt on the surfaces everywhere. Is this really the UK? Surely we are in some other country already? The second big problem is the overcrowding at the airport. There's hardly any room for passengers to me met at arrivals: the area has been taken from passengers and given to shops. It's also v congested in departures hard to get in and about little room to wait. The space has been given to shops so little left for passengers. And is this the last airport in the world which requires a coin to be inserted into the trolleys to obtain one?

It's becoming apparent that MAN is following the example of LHR and is doing a very good job of it - while passenger numbers have hardly rocketed in the past few years staff cuts are clearly taking their toll.

This was the first and I have to say it was an eye opener. My dislike of MAN is based on several trips where staff and facilities have been woefully short of the minimum you would expect. This last trip was a welcome exception. The fast track was operating well and the staff at screening were courteous and efficient (a first for me at MAN) and we were through in a few minutes. On my last return through MAN we were held on a corridor for over an hour with no explanation and then faced with surly immigration staff and long long waits for luggage to get onto the belt. To my immense relief the organisation was far better on this trip. The queues for immigration were relatively short and by using the automated booths were through in less than ten minutes. They do need more of these booths though and to keep them in working order. Baggage was on the belt within ten minutes of us reaching it and we were off the plane and out of the airport in a little under 30 minutes all told. A much better experience.

I asked why it was so bad and he replied that they were down to two scanners due to refurbishment and it was the busiest time of year. You really do have to question why they have chosen to do this refurbishment at the busiest time of year when it would clearly cause maximum disruption.

Pass through in less than 10 minutes also thanks to body-scanners. Agents professional and respect passengers. The duty free area is just the way I like it to be.

Most of the gates are just at hand but you should allow for a 5 minutes walk for the farthest at the two sides. Excellent view of apron.

This was on a day when inclement weather was anticipated and following two winter periods when airports were unprepared for bad weather. Manchester is clearly still not able to meet its obligations to passengers and airlines in poor weather. Prior to that departures was a mess with people joining wrong airline queues because of a lack of organisation. On return immigration was a breeze but we had to wait over 30 minutes for bags to come onto the line. When they did the line kept breaking down because of the way bags baby buggies and so forth were flung onto the belt causing it to jam.

The facilities are good the staff always polite and the place very clean. However they have a bad problem with baggage on low cost or budget airlines. It can take up to an hour for the bags to start coming. On a flight with Jet2 in November 2010 it took an hour and 30 minutes to clear the airport from landing to getting in a cab. This was down to the fact it took over and hour to get our bag even though we seemed to be the only flight in that terminal at that time. This is not uncommon and they do need to sort it out.

Transport to and from the airport to the city centre was quick easy and cheap by the train. Staff at the airport train station were helpful. What really gets me is the design of Terminal 1. The area before check- in made me want to get through security immediately; dark dingy and depressing. After check- in I found myself in what appeared to be a bright massive department store-come-shopping centre. Anything that might suggest the presence of aircraft and boarding gates were missing or lost amongst the neon glare of perfume counters and tobacco signs. I saw a young family who were obviously about to miss their flight frantically ask another passenger in the airport for directions to the gates because the entire terminal was designed to encourage as much transit shopping as possible and no thought was given to the fact that people actually had flights to catch. Confirmation of flight boarding gates are not announced until the flight is about ready to board so unlike almost every other airport I've ever used there is no option to just relax at the gate as you wait for your flight. The other downside of this is that if there's been a delay to your flight which there was both times I flew out of Manchester there's no one to turn to because the only staff around are shop assistants.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Brook,United Kingdom,2009-06-09,I have been using Manchester frequently over the past 15 years. Overall it's getting worse although with the recent addition of many more screening points the security queues are much shorter and efficient than the previous horrendous experience. Check in (having used many different airlines) is usually OK. As with any airport if you want to avoid long lines arrive early. In Terminal 1 beyond security I hate the way one is led through a maze of perfume stalls before reaching the departure lounge. I don't mind airport shops but not so 'in your face'. It really creates the wrong impression. They've avoided this particular folly in Terminal 2. T2 business lounge (mostly use Sky Team - KLM/Air France) is very small but adequate if not busy. Arrival experience is variable. Long delays in getting off the plane are common due to no one to operate the air bridge/no one to drive the mobile steps/no buses waiting when parking remotely. Queues at immigration have lengthened over the years as on average has waiting for the baggage. If using the long stay car park and pre-paying on the internet to avoid the extortionate on-the-day charges the part where you are supposed to insert your credit card at the entry barrier doesn't work. Instead call them at the exit barrier when you leave and quote your reference number. My card was charged correctly after this. Overall the airport looks shabby doesn't operate particularly well and can't really be called a pleasant experience.

Too many flights departing within a few minutes of each other in such a small space would make the claustrophobic and agoraphobic go into seizures. Only one set of toilets servicing 12 gates of wide body jets mean snaking queues especially for the ladies' room (singular). The sea of humanity makes the air-conditioning practically non existent.

Airside nothing to do unless you pay for the upstairs lounges. Limited and expensive food choices. On our return flight we had to queue for more than an hour to clear immigration and customs as our flight happened to have landed the same time as flights from the US (JAL DL) and Middle East (EK) did. Officials tried to rearrange the booths but did not do much good as the arrangement apparently created more chaos.

As many have stated it is just too old and too small to cope with the numbers of people trying to use it. Taxi had to queue to get up the ramp to drop me off at departures. I then had a 20 minute queue to get into the terminal building. I'd checked in online which meant that I used the fast bag drop which was ok but next queue was to be allowed into the immigration queue which was hundreds strong and took about 45 minutes. Final queue for security check and then into the ancient but at least quieter airside. Took about 90 minutes all told. I hear that is pretty good for Manila.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

At customs people needing visas need to line up in the ""visas"" line - if you line up anywhere else you'll just be told to go to the visa line. It's a bit confusing as the booth is slightly behind the others. Visas are US$25 cash there are no change facilities so be prepared. They take your money and passport and then walk over to an office near the baggage claim where the visas are processed. Everyone has to stand around and wait in front of the office until an immigration official walks out with a stack of passports and starts calling out names at which point they will give you back your passport with the visa inside. In the meantime you can collect your bags the carousel is literally 2 metres away. Plenty of taxis right out the front you can't miss them. Barclays ATM also just outside so easy to get local currency. Outbound the check-in is pretty straightforward though I would suggest getting there a bit early as it looks like it would get mad in a rush.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2009-09-02,My third report on MP2 will be my final one as I will never use this appalling shambles of a terminal again - the worst yet. As before my departure was on a Saturday afternoon in August but just four flights were scheduled to leave in the three hours after I arrived. MP2 could not cope. We arrived just over two hours before scheduled departure and had the flight left on time would have spent 1 hour 50 minutes queuing. Among the highlights were 24 minutes waiting to give passport details (after 36 minutes in the check-in desk queue) and being accused of not submitting them online - like everyone else in the queue I had not been asked to. Another half hour waiting for the border police officer to open his booth. The final insult was an extra 20 minutes at the departure gate as they could not let passengers off the incoming aircraft - the terminal door would not open. So we finally boarded the aircraft 2.5 hours after entering the terminal all but ten minutes standing in queues. This place is an utter mess: inefficient chaotic cheap nasty and with uncaring staff I speak and understand enough French to know that it was not just a language barrier; I will accept the security staff who were doing their best.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2008-08-26,Last August I wrote a rather damning review of MP2; this year I used the same terminal at more or less the same time of day and time of year. It has improved a little but there is still room for improvement. The queues are still there but they move more quickly; I timed everything very carefully. Check-in 10 minutes; luggage drop-off 4; security 21; passport control 10; boarding- pass check 9; boarding 8. However you look at it this is still an hour of continual queuing and as we were a little later than planned arriving at the airport it was literally moving from one queue to the next. The environment has not improved though I did feel the staff were more helpful and friendly than last time and generally it was not quite as awful. However the final episode illustrated some of the problems of MP2. With everyone on board on time the pilot announced that he could not start engines because there was so much rubbish blowing about on the apron. I was by a window and could see burst rubbish bags from aircraft just left lying around. We waited 15 minutes while some of it was cleared up but it was far from completely clear when we left. The whole place feels very uncared-for and it is obvious that costs have been cut wherever possible; as I said last time I understand the economics of low-cost flying but this seems to be a step too far - to the point where it is counterproductive in terms of efficiency and customer satisfaction.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However last week I endured the new terminal 2 (warehouse would be a better description) for low-cost airlines; it is a truly horrible experience. I know that when travelling low-cost it is just that and you get what you pay for but this takes the concept to a whole new (lower) level. They obviously did not waste any money on decorating as it is mainly bare walls pipes concrete floors etc. On the few places they actually put some paint it is the most disgusting mixture of lime green purple and orange you can imagine. You get plenty of time to admire the 'design' of this box as you queue to put your luggage onto a conveyor belt (about 20 minutes and quite what cost it saves is beyond me) and to go through security (about 45 minutes). If this is the future of mass air transport it will surely kill itself it is a totally joyless and annoying experience.

Arrivals however is another story. We arrived along with so many others last Saturday morning. They had three booths open for citizens and four for international visitors. I tried the E passport but it didn't work for me so I joined the long line up. The man there at the E passport area was screaming at people so was not exactly approachable for help. I think he is well and truly jaded about his job there. After the long shuffle through passport control our bags were collected fast and thank goodness they have now barriers for people to walk through for customs rather than having people cut in line as was the case previously. So they have made an improvement. Having more friendly staff with E passports needs to be addressed, especially with those oldies like me that have never used this technology before. The last thing you want after a long haul overnight flight is to be yelled out for not doing it ""right"", without being told the right way to do it. Funny the biggest problems with Melbourne airport would and could be fixed for free yet they seem reluctant to address them. Odd. Would I recommend?

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,C Fairfax,Australia,2014-10-13,Arrived mid morning from the US to be confronted by chaos. An announcement was made advising that passport processing had been stopped due to overcrowding in the baggage area. At least one self serve machine was not working but eventually found one that was and processed self only to discover that the exit points were seething with people all pushing. There was no organisation and no one to advise people where to go. Many people had got into the self service queue without the required pass and were then fighting against the crowd to get out. Why can't the airport provide cordoned off runs for this like they do at other airports? After getting to the baggage hall it was a struggle to view the inconveniently located board to see which carousel to go to. After a long wait for luggage we proceeded past a customs employee towards the exits only to be then told to return to the back of the hall and get in the line which now snaked around the whole area. I am at a loss to understand why Mr Useless did not have the customer service skills to start directing the traffic at the appropriate time. Doing so would go a long way to calming people instead of making them angrier at the disgrace that is the arrivals hall. An explanation of end of school holidays is no explanation. School holiday dates are listed 5 years in advance- surely enough time to roster staff appropriately. On eventual exit we entered a taxi line where an occasional cab arrived until we realised none were being directed to the rank by the taxi manager. We had to walk down to request a maxi taxi (of which there are not enough) for groups arriving with luggage. There was no sign or person advising that the centre cab rank was not working.

The domestic terminals are always packed with people and the international arrivals is a source of national shame. The luggage takes forever and the lines through to customs often start near customs.

I asked baggage services for a handler to come and either put the unclaimed bags on the floor or rearrange them on the belt to fit more on. Refused to do either citing work practice rules.

Eventually Y class bags and finally most of the J bags. A 90 minute wait. I contacted baggage services 3 times during this period. Walkie-talkie calls to the baggage room below described chaos down there. Then got into customs queue. It was approx 400 meters long snaking along 3 walls of the baggage hall. Two yes two customs officers were at the exit causing the backlog. Why not 10 officers? All in all an absolute disgrace.

The arrivals area is poor in several respects - charging for baggage carts is plain mean. The baggage claim area is woefully inadequate even for an Airbus A330 - there is simply not enough space on the carousel meaning that the bags queue up in the chute and are released one at a time as others are claimed. This leads to long delays in baggage recovery. Presumably bags from a fully loaded A380 or 747 take twice as long to recover. The customs area is also cramped and subject to long queues.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2013-01-02,I have travelled through the airport a few times for international trips over the past years. Depart from here has always been quite a smooth affair especially on Jetstar who seem to have extra short waiting times for check-in. Departures section is well-lit comfortable and easy to navigate. Deletion of the upstairs observation decks and windows to the food court on Level 1 are a sad move but place no impact on overall operations. Departures staff seem to be kind. International arrivals however are a completely different story. While they have added extra parking spaces for A380 aircraft's the immigration and customs facilities have become smaller and slower. MEL has the worst arrivals experience I have experienced more so than airports like Manila and Dhaka. On my most recent return to Australia it took 2 hours to clear immigration with the queues stretching through to the duty free section. Arrivals staff are rude and impatient hardly a welcoming face for first time foreign visitors. This is before we even get to the building itself which has almost no windows on the lower levels along with low ceiling heights cold lighting and an industrial-feel ambience. There is a real need for extra customs and immigration space (not just extra aircraft gates). The existing building has served us well over the past 40 years but is now outdated and unable to cope with the capacity demands of modern high-capacity aircraft. Other side notes are the over-priced parking and lack of meaningful (and affordable) public transport to and from the city 25kms away.

If you are checking in from 89 onwards these are just before the Virgin domestic terminal - the illogical layout makes this a baffling ordeal for travellers. Security and immigration have recently been upgraded and it shows but then there is the hike through retail shops to get to departure gates which are old and outmoded. A collection of four or five gates serviced by toilets and a few overpriced drink and snack machines. Returning was an endurance test. On arrival one is greeted by a low-ceilinged shabby corridor and queues at immigration. My baggage was on carousel 5 which is the newer one but to get to it you have to cut through waiting throngs of passengers lining up afor the exit and waiting for baggage at carousels 3 and 4. The queue to exit begins between two baggage carousels a winding path to customs officers and then another trek with queues to quarantine to have your luggage scanned. Total time elapsed from aircraft arrival at gate to exiting this overcrowded mess: 1hr 55 minutes. Once out transport options are limited to the red bus going to the city (express running a very elastic 10 minutes) at the bargain price of AUD15 or taxis. That's it.

To our amazement it took less than 20 minutes from touching-down until we walked out of the terminal. We travelled Business Class and having priority baggage handling helped to obtain our cases quicker than was the case on our previous Economy flight. While we used the Smartgate service the few passengers using the traditional Immigration lines at the same time meant we didn't progress any quicker than they did at that point.

We disembarked at about 2220 & collected our luggage at the carousel at 2245. Ominously there were approximately 150 people queued for Customs when we first arrived at the carousel. By the time passengers from our flight had collected their luggage there was a single queue that snaked twice around carousel 1 before feeding into the existing three lines of people who had been waiting when we arrived. As we waited patiently passenger from another flight collected their bags & joined the queues. It took until 2345 to reach a Customs Officer & be waved though after a quick check of our luggage. I don't blame Customs staff who were obviously doing their best with patience & good humour but seeing almost everyone being asked to open their cases I could understand the delays. I doubt whether too many people waiting to clear Customs that night would have any positive thoughts about Melbourne Airport or maybe Melbourne & Australia in general.

We had already been screened in Norwich and Amsterdam but to be screened on arrival is over the top. Some people in the queue missed connecting flights as a result of this extra screening.

mexico-city-airport,/airport-reviews/mexico-city-airport,Mexico City Airport customer review,A O'Brien,Ireland,2011-06-25,Recently travelled through both terminals on my way from Paris-Puerto Vallarta.

T1 on the other hand is dark showing its age and the air con barely works. It took nearly 40 min to clear immigration on arrival but with the amount of flights arriving from Europe most evenings this is to be expected. Security at both terminals was very fast. The most frustrating thing is having to clear customs in Mexico City and then haul my luggage over to T2. Signage for the Sky train is useless in T1 in fact signage overall is poor in T1.

mexico-city-airport,/airport-reviews/mexico-city-airport,Mexico City Airport customer review,N Taylor,Mexico,2011-05-04,I wouldn't normally write a review like this but after waiting almost two hours (standing up) for my in-laws a few days ago I wanted to share my renewed unhappiness with this airport. We would have been able to escape to the American Express lounge but unfortunately my hubby had forgotten his card. I am British but I live in Mexico City thus I have no choice but to grit my teeth and face this horrendous airport several times per year. I therefore also mainly travel through Terminal One. Terminal Two is a bit more pleasant in that it is newer but my review refers to T1. Departing from Mexico City is much better than arriving however it still leaves much to be desired. Taxis are good and inexpensive (make sure you pre-book to get a secure white/red taxi and never hail the green/white taxis or the red/gold taxis. The special sirport taxis are white and yellow and are also safe) and the airport is located in fairly close proximity to the city centre so in theory it should be fairly quck to arrive there. However with traffic in Mexico City it can take much much longer than expected so be aware of this to avoid missing flights. If you make your own way there by car strangely for a major airport it is not signposted until you are practically there so you need to be fairly sure of where you are going before you attempt this. It is also located in a fairly off putting and run down part of town so it is not the kind of place you want to get lost in. This also goes for leaving the airport. Parking can be difficult at peak times. Inside the airport - during the summer months the heat can be awful I am not sure if there is air conditioning or if it just doesn't function when needed. It can be tricky to get to where you want to go as Departures and Arrivals are very poorly signposted and the lay out is confusing. So far when I have checked in here I haven't had to wait too long as I always make a point of checking in online and getting there early and using the bag drop when I fly British Airways however we did face a bit of a queue flying with Iberia. I have not experienced too many going through security either so they have obviously organised outgoing flights a bit better than the incoming flights. Passing security facilities are fairly average. As other reviewers have said the terminal is fairly shabby and could do with a renovation but at the end of the day that would probably cause utter chaos. Some of the gates have absolutely no seating areas whatsoever so you basically just have to stand until you are able to board which can take a long time. Arriving in Mexico City - a completely different story and the main reason for the very low scores. Do not expect anything to happen quickly as several large European flights all arrive at almost exactly the same time every day (approx 7pm). Strangely after disembarking the plane arriving passengers are ushered through the arrivals lounge and all is a bit confusing. The queues at passport control are generally frightful and can take over an hour both in the line for nationals and non-nationals (after receiving conflicting information about which I should use as a holder of a Mexican Resident's Visa I have used both). Baggage claim is equally horrendous with several flights worth of baggage arriving on one carrousel whilst many others remain empty. Again there is limited airconditioning so it can be especially unpleasant in the warm summer months. After finally picking up your bags you then have to queue again to have all your luggage scanned (don't expect any help with this - I was travelling alone literally moving my life from London to Mexico City and had a significant amount of luggage as a result three members of staff simply watched while I struggled to load the cases onto the belt - same story when I took them out and put them back on the trolley) and they never open up all the scanners so again this can take a long time. After scanning your bags you then have to hit a button - green means go but if it comes up red you have to have your luggage inspected by an officer. This is also worth remembering when picking someone up do not rush to get there when the flight lands as it is a waste of time as they can take another two hours on top of that. Queues for taxis can be long especially if you need a larger vehicle and once in your car/taxi there is still Mexican rush hour traffic to contend with through a not-so-nice part of town.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

We were marshalled around by nasty airport employees who had no problem screaming at people for not moving fast enough in the interminable queue. This was more like arriving in a backwater rather than in one of the primary gateways to the world's leading economy. Are we not welcome? After 90 minutes we got through amidst crying babies and numerous other distressed weary travelers. Once through passport control we collected our luggage which had been piled up with the rest of the flight's baggage in the middle of the claim area as the carrousels needed to be freed up for other arriving flights. Then we had to queue up for another 30 minutes to get through another control which consisted of an officer looking at our customs declaration and waiving us through. Add another 1.5 hours to deal with the inefficiency of the car hire company and we were on our way. From airport exit to airport exit close to 4 hours. We have to travel to Florida for family reasons but in the future we'll travel to Miami via a connection in order to enter the US through an airport that respects basic human dignity.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Long walk to immigration 2 hours in an interminable line luggage arrives 3 hours late with no one from the airlines around for miles to help customers distraught as they were missing their flights. Not even an announcement to say the bags were delayed. No one from BA to receive our bags as the signage pointed I'm the opposite direction and no one generally to help transit passages at all.

Miami Intl makes transiting in Frankfurt a marvellous experience.

Staff at Miami appear to be trained to be rude and unhelpful to passengers. We asked a female staff if we could go in front of the massive queue as we were just about to miss our flight and she said if we miss our flight we just miss it. After immigration one has to endure the other queue to get through customs which is another awful experience. There were more than 1000 arriving passengers and only two members of staff dealing with the queue. We waited an eternity for our bags at carrousel 8 where it was announced they will be delivered. However they were delivered at 6 and we were not told of the changes. Staff just do not care about passengers.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,H Shah,United Kingdom,2012-07-31,We were unfortunate enough to have to transit through this airport on 15th July 2012. The problems started when we were instructed by an extremely rude airport official to form two lines (left hand side for US citizens and right hand side for everyone else). However on entering the immigration area all the US citizen booths were on the right and everyone else on the left causing chaos and confusion. We waited over an hour in a line which did not seem to move . At this point we were thinking that a 3 hour transit would not be sufficient. Worrying that we may miss our transit into Lima my wife asked the same rude official if there was a separate line for transit passengers. Once again he was rude and unhelpful and said we should wait in the same line or find one that was shorter as there wasn't a separate line! After waiting another half an hour we found a helpful lady who directed us towards a transit booth.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,E Williams,NA,2009-05-05,MIA is not a passenger-friendly airport. I usually fly in and out of MIA on domestic flights - only if I cannot avoid it. Do not consider flying into this airport unless you can handle the minimum 15-20 minute hike from the security screening area to your gate. The later your flight arrives or departs at MIA the further your gate will be from the exit to the terminal. If you have the misfortune of arriving before 7am or after 10pm the stores will be closed the fast food and sit-down restaurants are all closed and you will walk past seemingly miles of empty gates to get to the terminal or your gate. There are no moving sidewalks in the concourse areas so be prepared to hike. If you are disabled by all means try to avoid this airport at all costs. The newer terminals are pleasant to look at but uncomfortable to navigate to. MIA is a rabbit's warren of zig-zagging white wallboard mazes with poor signage and a lack of decent food service or practical traveler shops. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the airport terminal or concourse layout and you usually must exit one concourse and recheck through security to get to another. Even if you are headed in the right direction you will need good walking shoes. MIA is laid out for the administrators security and airlines benefit - not the passengers. The taxi cab drivers are rude if you don't have too far to go from the airport and parking at the Economy Park and Ride is an adventure unto itself with a lack of passenger clearly marked pickup/drop-off areas. Good luck finding your way around this airport. With all the money that has been spent the only improvements I've been able to discern have been cosmetic.

Various terminals not all linked so to get from one flight to another you may well have to exit the secure area walk a ways and then go back through another security line (similar to many other airports; need to keep this in mind when calculating transit times). Terminal J still in the process of being finished so fewer choices for dining and shopping than in some other areas (you can get to Terminal H without exiting security). One nice thing about MIA is the number of hotels near the airport. Even one inside the terminal itself though it is not cheap and the rooms are rather small.

Officials were marshalling excess visitors into residents booths and keeping the whole thing moving. Surroundings were light and airy and fairly clean. They have introduced the ten digit scan but it was not unduly time consuming. My immigration official was pleasant. Baggage was fairly swift.

Recently went to Terminal 2 for the first time: arrival not bad though getting on a bus when the terminal building was about 20 metres from the front of the aircraft is a bit frustrating. Departing was considerably worse: security was quick though that was where the efficiency ended. Not enough seats and limited food facilities. Worse followed though: we knew the flight was delayed by '45 minutes' (not the airport's fault it was foggy). We were then called to the gate about 30 minutes before 'departure' by a message on the screens ; after about 20 minutes we were told that we were at the wrong gate (and treated as if it was our fault) so we all went to the right gate where we stood for another 30 minutes before the aircraft arrived. We were then cleared to stand for a further 20 minutes before being allowed to board the aircraft it eventually left the stand 90 minutes after the scheduled time. I am not complaining about the delay bad weather in January is a hazard of flying but the airport must have known it was going to be much more than 45 minutes late a couple of hours in advance why did they not inform us? Also why did they have 100 people just standing around for well over an hour again they must have known - we could have shared the sparse seating.

The airport also is a reflection of the largest airline serving it: Alitalia. Despite the airport being less than 10 years old it is already showing a tired interior - dingy terminals chaos at the security checks between the terminals and the bussing to the majority of the aircraft is a disgrace. I along with many others do not understand why the Italian gov't selected such a poor architectural design for this airport... They want to develop this airport further as an important hub but how can they if they didn't build enough gates??? It's not appealling and in the hot summer months the bus services are unbearable. Airport personnel are also lacking in manners and do not know what organisation is....they show up late at the gates ignore passengers seeking information etc. etc. The list goes on and on. With regards to shops and catering - it's alright though very overpriced. And the lack of seating is a disgrace too.

mombasa-airport,/airport-reviews/mombasa-airport,Mombasa Airport customer review,W Pechler,Netherlands,2012-09-03,Arrived from Nairobi and flew to Amsterdam on September 2nd 2012. Baggage arrived quickly from our domestic flight couldn't immediately find international departures but were helped friendly at the outside service desk. Security went fast but that could be attributed to the fact that it was a very quiet day (only 2 international flights departing after 3 pm) and we were early. Enough available power sockets for charging. Check-in opened a little over 3 hours before departure once again we were helped by a couple of very friendly guys. Staff on the lower floor overall was kind and helpful but we asked 3 different people if there was either a Burger King McDonalds or KFC at the airport and none of them gave us a straight 'no' answer they all directed us to the small sandwich counter on the second floor. On the second floor staff spoke poor English. Passport control went fast but was arbitrary they asked for my entire right hand (4 fingers + thumb) to be scanned while my sister and father didn't need to have their thumbs scanned. Free wireless internet of fairly good speed but very limited reach. A dozen or so of duty free shops. Half the ceiling fans were broken but since the second floor is not entirely walled up the fresh wind from outside cooled the waiting area down enough. No power sockets at gate 3/4 no toilets either if you need to go you can just walk right back. After asking very politely and kindly if there was a way I could charge my laptop for the long flight (13 hours) they agreed I could charge it behind a desk at the security check where I left it out of sight for over half an hour and I'm happy to say my faith in humanity remains the same it was right there where I left it when we boarded right on time.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The new airport is brilliant with three levels. The lower level is the arrivals level the main level is the departure level and the upper level is a observation deck with airside views. All three levels are connected by escalators. The building has a soaring roof which enhances the spaciousness of the facility. Check in (PLUNA) was handled quickly. After check in you pay the airport tax and then proceed through security which was done by Air force personnel who were quite thorough and also polite. After security you go through a large duty Free aerea and into the waiting section. There is a full service restaurant on this floor (no fast food court) and the entire area looks out over the aircraft apron.

Domodedovo is over crowded which I think is where all its problems begin. After we passed through the understaffed and poorly organised passport control we found the baggage carousel empty not because they were slow unloading the plane but because they needed it for another flight so they'd dumped the London bags in a corner at the other end of the reclamation hall. Departing was an exercise in queuing even though I had mastered the Russian art of queue barging by the end of my trip. After the security and passport checks which felt very much like a legacy of the Soviet era we needed refreshments and while the extortionate prices couldn't put us off the lack of anywhere to sit nearly did. More waiting areas are needed to get people out of the cafe areas. Toilets were dirty and crowded furtive smokers lurked in the cubicles. Somebody had set a paper towel bin alight presumably with a discard cigarette and a cleaning lady was left to put it out by scooping handfuls of water from the taps. Our queue for the gate was in the middle of a narrow and busy corridor right next to the smouldering toilets.

To access the terminal you and your baggage have to go through security scanners which slows things up. The terminal is completely overcrowded which makes moving around with cases challenging. Check in was ok but passport control customs and security were very slow. The officials only seem to speak Russian which can be a problem if something goes wrong. I forgot to remove my wrist watch before going through the scanner. Once you get to the departure areas we could only find two small places to get food and drink and they are very expensive. Two cheese and ham croissants a small cappuccino and a small beer came to over £27. The whole departure area was overcrowded with far too few seats for the number of passengers.

The same is at the return flight from Prague to Moscow where the flight again stopped at gate F. My staff (3 pax) flew a couple of days earlier and lost their last connection. Left for 5 hours with no assistance no information and the took them to a substandard hotel and no food. When asking why was the flight delayed they were sent to a corner like some unruly kids.

On arrival from Tokyo Narita the plane was not parked at a gate. As we left the plane I saw someone waiting with a board with my name on it and I was ushered into a car. We drove in silence around the airport arrived at some unmarked gates and I was led into a hotel lounge and told to sit down and relax. There was a bar and food was also available. An immigration officer requested my passport and later came over and returned it to me. My luggage tag was requested and eventually luggage appeared. Friends who were meeting me appeared and we drove into Moscow. This lounge was full of people and I was told that there were four such VIP lounges in the airport. The return trip was equally surreal. Mercedes is the preferred transportation vehicle and we duly arrived at the double doors. This time there was a short walk to the hotel lounge. My e-ticket was somewhere in my luggage but it was never requested. I was told that with this way of passing through the airport one did not need a ticket. A little while later another vehicle took me to the gate. A stern official gave me my boarding pass and wished me a good flight - and I found that had been upgraded.

Having arrived at and departed from Mumbai's international and domestic terminals several times over the past two decades I can honestly say that the new Terminal 2 represents a quantum leap in (for the most part) vastly improving the passenger experience. This includes the new elevated access ramp to the terminal from the Western Express Highway. The terminal building itself is an architectural wonder. There is lots of glass all owing expansive views of the airport. Spacious seating / waiting areas with clear flight boarding announcement. Slightly secluded seating areas with relaxing arm chairs and modular sofa type seating configurations. Numerous bistros and coffee shops in a shopping mall type of a layout. Interesting and original retail outlets. As this was the first day of operations several stores were not yet open or had goods displayed but were not available for shopping. Nevertheless the store managers invited us to have a look around. Likewise the duty free shops were still stocking up with only a few items for sale. Washrooms were very clean and well distributed throughout the terminal. One aspect that could be improved is the still cumbersome process of passport and visa checks for outbound passengers which seems to be largely bureaucratic and unnecessary. There was a long snaking line for this checkpoint before proceeding to the airside retail food and gate area which was tiresome and resulted in us feeling a bit too exhausted to fully explore the various stores and eateries.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Anish Patil,Netherlands,2010-07-27,The airport has transformed in recent years - it was quite clean less noisy and chaotic and a decent airport experience. Quite a change from few years back. The only gripe was the traffic/chaos outside the airport. Due to security reasons the traffic police just allows one row of vehicles to the airport departures due to which there was a huge traffic jam and this combined with the sea of people saying good byes to their loved ones means a huge chaos. But once inside the airport it all changes. I did not have to queue anywhere (checkin immigration security) for more than 10 minutes. I think within 20-30 minutes from check in I was at the Lufthansa lounge. I did a brief walk through the airport before boarding and saw nice restaurants cafes and duty free.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,D Gill,United Kingdom,2009-11-11,It took me at least half an hour to get from the start of the terminal building to my entrance. This was due to the unorganised volume of people and traffic allowed to congregate outside. Armed guards only allow passengers inside the terminal building. Once you have made it through all the people to get inside you have to get your luggage scanned and security taped before check-in will take it. They tell most people this after queuing at the check-in desk (not useful). The international departure concourse for the most part looked like it is falling apart despite renovation (though the internal departure concourse in another terminal was newly designed and looked good). Immigration is painfully slow and immigration staff seem to think everyone is a suspect. Security is a joke as their methods are inconsistent. One guy will pat one passenger while the guy next to him doesn't bother with his passenger. Queues are the longest I've ever seen at security and this was at 11.00 at night. They changed the gate of my flight without any announcement only finding it by chance. Unfortunately it is the main port of entry to southern India so be aware of the differences compared to western airports and go with the flow as it is easy to get frustrated here with everything.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Had to wait several minutes for a bus to take passengers to terminal. Not sure if this lack of an airbridge was due to our 40 minute delay in leaving London Heathrow. Once in terminal transit experience is very smooth with information screens and signs clearly indicating where you need to go. No further immigration or security screens for our transit. Toilets clean and plentiful with really cool hand dryers! Plenty of seating at the departure gates. Wide walkways surrounded by the usual shops. Baggage was transferred from our incoming to outgoing flight without problem so well done to the ground handlers whoever they are. Boarding gate staff pleasant. As to be expected usual expensive prices for food and drink: 1 tea 2 cappuccino's and what was described as a cheese 'paninni' came to just over £20 (I'm not kidding).

Public areas are a little bit narrow which causes crowdedness when several flights arrive or depart at one specific departure zone.

The passport control security people that I encountered were apathetic and arrogant I am sad to say. I inadvertently got into a line for EU passports only and needed to go to the back of the ""All Passport"" line even though my flight was boarding by that time. I felt that if I said anything the situation would only get worse because they didn't seem to care whether I made my flight or missed it. The shops were beautiful but I had no time to stop and visit because I needed to run to make my connection. Again I am grateful that my bag made it to my connecting flight.

This was my first experience with MUC and has left me with mixed feelings. The airport is very clean and fair amount of shopping.. nothing great but sufficient. Arrival from AUH with a full A330-200 (shorter version). The line for passport control was very long and slow. Only 2 passport control officers available and the containment area for the passengers was ridiculously small and claustrophobic even with lots of glass around opening the ""area"" optically. I cannot even imagine how would the place look like in the rush hour of if a couple of flights arrived at the same time. At departure the chaos was unbelievable. Again small containment area with check in counters (around 10 at a time) and passport control just next to them. So today around apx. 700 passengers stood in a chaotic and long and incredibly slow lined mixing with people trying to get to check in counters. 3 flights (London Moscow and Izmir) were boarding so many passengers had to get to the front of the line to catch their flights. Passport control couldn't even process faster as the lines were stuck as Xrays were just behind the booths making the process even more painful.

The Airport charges for use of luggage trolleys in the departure area regardless of whether you will return the trolley - anyway odd to charge for a major international airport and when you have paid airport taxes. The security check was strange - after my bag went through the x-ray machine it had to go through the x-ray machine again but with my bag open and in a position where everything could potentially fall out.

The return trip was even busier and check-in would have been better if they had opened earlier as the area was heaving with people as was the queue for security which was snaked in a line around the hall. Tempers become frayed when people don't seem to understand the need to go to the end of the line as courtesy to other passengers.

This leads to a considerable stockpile of water and alcohol the destination of which is unclear while passengers dehydrate in departure lounges which are too small for the planes which they serve.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,Harold Bush,NA,2008-07-14,I queued for 45 minutes just to get into the terminal; the attendant dealing with the queue kept letting Kenyan nationals in front of the queue while there was no one at the receiving end of the screening machine to help passengers. Immigration control was quick. Sadly the airport facilities are very limited with hardly any seats but lots of shops. It looks really like a shopping centre. Annoyingly my BA flight was meant to leave (and left) at 2345 but the screens indicated it was departing at 2320. Having queued for such a long time just to get into the terminal I had no option but to go straight to the special area for BA passengers after passing through two more layers of security. Extraordinary! This airport needs a serious facelift and more consideration for passengers.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Check-in area seemed very busy but queues all seemed relatively short. Security was very quick (we were through the normal channel in less than 5 minutes). Good selection of shops and places to eat although no English language newspapers were left for sale. Places to eat had decent food at reasonable prices for an airport. Some excellent seating areas with leather sofas and lamps - more like a hotel lobby than an airport.

The same cannot be said for baggage reclaim. It took almost 30 mins from arriving in the hall for our bags to get to the belt. On leaving the security staff were courteous and all scanners were in operation so the process was over in moments. Having passed through security we found what we thought was the main departures area with a couple of shops and a cafe which was inundated with people wanting to buy drinks and food. The system was chaotic and staff spoke little or no English. Seating was woefully inadequate. It was not signposted and we did not find out until it was too late that there were more shops and bar/dining opportunities adjacent to the departure gates with adequate seating!

naples-airport,/airport-reviews/naples-airport,Naples Airport customer review,John Oram,NA,2005-04-20,NAP offers the traveller two experiences different for arriving and departing passengers. It is perhaps a little disturbing that it is more pleasant to depart. On arrival there are no air bridges and the arrivals hall is dim and busy. It reminded me of ALC 20 years ago; ALC has moved on. I would not like to have seen the busy baggage claim busier. There was also some pretty insane crowding towards a single exit from the terminal building itself - not strictly necessary as there were other exits available such as the one to which we followed our driver. Departing NAP 22 April I experienced a swift check-in open early and was offered (didn't have to request) an exit row. Airside the departure lounge was light and airy with an excellent cafe/lounge which has a great view. Crowding at the B gates of the departure area is caused as much as anything by the continuing refusal of our government to sign the Schengen agreement - Schengen departures enjoyed more of the light airy circulating area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

nassau-airport,/airport-reviews/nassau-airport,Nassau Airport customer review,J Hagen,NA,2008-03-10,"The vast majority of problems with this airport pertain to the delays of having to travel back to the US. If you are travelling to any other country (international) security is a breeze. For example travelling to Toronto Montreal or London: simply check-in with the agent walk down 40 feet to the right to the security area and walk through the detector. After this quick security screening you have reached the ""international lounge area"" where you just sit and wait to board. It takes about 20 minutes in total if there isn't a big line up at check in. Just be there an hour early to make sure your bags get on the plane but they should since NAS is a small airport. The BIG problem is travel to the US. If this is your case you should be at the airport at least 2.5 hours in advance due to all the TSA regulations. The Bahamians are just following protocol but they sometimes exagerrate when they confiscate possessions (eg golfballs were taken from me) and they are rude and brush you off when you ask why. Expect at least 3 security checkpoints a carry-on search (1 on 2 chance of having that done) and for the unlucky a random spot check (1 on 6 chance of having that done). These are all measures the TSA has enforced in the Bahamas and have to be followed by Bahamian security personnel. The US Customs line can be really long and slow especially during lunch hour when the bulk of the flights are leaving. You would think they could have more agents out at that hour and save the lunch for 2 PM when things calm down. During Christmas break and spring break the Bahamian Customs area for arriving passengers can be packed and lines can take over an hour if 4-5 flights arrive at once. Otherwise it is extremely smooth. The biggest problem with the airport is the fact that it is just SO old and in dire need of renovation. The restaurant in the US departures lounge is way overpriced and the food is horrible. Ultimately the image the airport conveys is that of a tiny island airport you'd see at a Bahamian island like Long Island-- this is not an airport suited for the capital Nassau. Also the baggage area has no security and lost bags are thrown everywhere. It is a mess to see for tourists. But the baggage people who can be paid to place your bags on a chariot and wheeled out are helpful and informative. They are worth the $5 tip since they'll also get you a taxi/limo. Overall this airport is a 5/10 but people should not base coming to the Bahamas because of the airport. It is a great country with much to offer simply a little slow as the expressions go.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal 1 (Lufthansa Turkish Austrian Air France etc) is a disgrace: third-world airports put it to shame. Half of the drinking fountains do not work. Electrical outlets for computers are scarce. Signage is largely absent or unhelpful. There appears to be no effective control of temperature or air circulation. TSA screening for passengers boarding international flights was excessively prolonged and confusing. Terminal 1 punishes arriving international passengers with non-operative escalators and moving walkways as they drag their luggage towards TSA and Customs. Terminal 1 at JFK is a fraud: charging exorbitant airline fees for services that if does not provide. On the other hand Terminals 2 and 4 - operated by Delta - are clearly customer-oriented. While making flight connections there on April 24 and May 2 2015 Delta personnel and clear signage made navigating those terminals pleasant and even happy. The temperature inside was comfortable and there were ample seats and electrical outlets for computer users. I will do my best to avoid any airline operating out of the pit that is Terminal 1 at JFK. I would welcome flights through Terminals 2 and 4 at JFK because Delta Airlines obviously cares about passengers' comfort in its terminals at JFK.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Agents were much friendlier and efficient. The terminal has become extremely airy and open with tons of shops and dining options. Gate area were much cozier and comfortable. Also arrived at JFK at T4 on a fully loaded Emirates A380 along with three other international flights.

I include in the positive those individuals who check passengers prior to boarding. I recently traveled with a delicate gift which I requested to be hand checked. The supervisor came to me and said that it had to go through the x-ray machine but he would stay right by it to make sure it got through without being knocked around. He stuck to his word and helped me take it off the track making sure I got all my other items. Being welcomed back into your own country is a real plus.

Had already discussed that we would avoid this airport for any future flights. My first impression was it resembled the most chaotic airport ever just mass confusion as if no one had a plan to manage various aspects of airport services gates etc. the restrooms are appalling dirty no working door closure on the stall used - basically unbelievable. The gates did not have enough seating people leaned up against the walls of a restaurant. It is difficult to even locate a gate because food services seem to share the same spot as passengers boarding a plane. When deplaning you are on your own to figure out how to proceed through immigration customs baggage etc. After leaving Heathrow and Frankfurt this airport is shameful in comparison and a very poor first impression to anyone visiting the states for the first time.

The most recent example was a few days ago arriving into Terminal 8 Saturday evening at 11pm. Baggage was total chaos and took 1.5 hours after landing to finally get our bags. It will never change. The best preparation if you must fly through JFK (or EWR or LGA) is to learn in advance everything about what must be done - where you need to go and whatever procedures you need to go through so then you need to rely on the poor customer service to a far lessor degree and then it will be less painful.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

I arrived from Dublin with Aer Lingus so I was fortunate enough to skip the immigration queue (as we had pre-cleared US customs in Dublin). We were lead through the airport to a shabby looking baggage reclaim used for the T4 domestic flights and the bags came quickly and I was on the airtrain within 20 minutes of arriving at the gate (a feat that not even the much smaller Glasgow airport can accomplish half the time with domestic arrivals!). My return was a similarly painless procedure. Check in had short queues (although I had arrived ridiculously early) but you do have to haul your baggage from the check in area to a separate bag drop area with visible X-Ray scanners. Appeared to be a bit of a security nightmare and you simply had to leave your bag in a big pile and the security team put it into the scanner. There are plenty of shops before security. Sadly the prices are insulting even by airport standards. $5 for a bottle of water $2.99 for a packet of crisps and $4.39 for a packet of gummy sweets. There are a few places that are much more reasonable. Sadly not enough seats available before security but if you look around enough you'll probably find some (particularly towards the A gates). Security was fantastic. There were very short queues and that was with busy flights going out to supposedly ""high risk"" areas. Staff were very friendly and helpful. There's not much though security in the B gates area but plenty of seating. Overall I didn't find cleanliness to be a particular issue. We did have a long taxi to get to our takeoff but that's to be expected with a busy airport. I'd happily fly to and from JFK again.

We have had poor previous experiences at JFK and we braced for another. This time was better. Facility was clean signs were clear along the way to customs helpful staff were visible with forms and keeping the lines moving. The CBP officer reviewing our passport was friendly and efficient. After retrieving our baggage and giving it again to American for the domestic flight to San Diego we then got our surprise. Terminal 8 is not fully secure meaning that cleared travelers exiting customs to go on to another American domestic flight must go through security again. That meant the duty free sealed glass items we purchased in the secure Milan terminal would not be allowed by TSA - they take it or you are escorted out right away. American Air staff at the counter went out of her way to find boxes to help us pack these items and checked it through at no additional fee.

I passed through transferring between an international flight and a domestic flight. Every aspect of the experience was horrible. Lines for customs baggage check-in and security all were terrible. Concessions were ridiculously expensive ($7 for a small bottle of juice at the deli) and of marginal quality. The terminal also had by far the most confusing layout and most useless signage that I've ever experienced.

There has never been a convincing argument for removing shoes and the DHS/TSA are clearly oblivious to the physical effort this requires for some.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,B Marcus,United States,2013-07-23,I have been using this airport for many years now and I am starting to dislike the place. Departing from Terminal C was a little bit of a hassle going through the Premier Access line for security. I waited over 20 minutes. The two United Clubs were a little worn and I feel they should invest money to renovate them. I also made some observations while I was walking around the terminal before my 16 hour flight. Terminal C especially C1 and C2 are starting to show its age a little bit and almost looks like a dirty bus terminal. Luckily I didn't need it but the United Customer service lines were massive with about 200 people on it and only one customer service agent on duty. The dining options are Not bad. My worst experience was coming through Terminal C International Arrivals. My flight came in on time and everything was going well until I saw the massive immigration line that took over an hour. There were three major flight that arrived and there were only 4 immigration officers on duty while there were at least 20 empty booths. I got my bags and the customs line took 10 minutes. As I was leaving I made another observation The United Transfer desk line for connecting flights was just as long as the immigration line. People in line were actually sitting on their bags. There were literally only 2 agents helping over 300 people. Luckily Newark was my final destination. Based on what I saw any connection less than three hours is a really tight connection. Maybe even three hours isn't enough. I always used Newark because there were hardly any lines and it was easier to use than JFK.

Why do they go out of their way to make you feel unwelcome and of course give visitors a very negative first opinion of the US. I will avoid this airport whenever possible indeed avoiding the US altogether as a transit country is a high priority for me given the requirement to clear immigration even if you aren't staying in the country. Canada surely there is an opportunity here for you. I also agree with others that in most respects it is user unfriendly. It is poorly signed and even simple things like finding the hotel shuttles can be a real trial and certainly something one can do without after a long international flight.

I (and I'm sure many of the other reviewers) have entered more than one other country as a foreigner (as well as the US through other airports) and so will have a fair idea of what to expect from immigration control officials. I witnessed an incident of an officer being unduly rude to a fellow traveller in a similar way to an incident in a previous review so this must not be all that isolated or unusual. Waiting times for baggage and to go through other security areas could also be improved. I was not there at a particularly busy period and yet waiting times were significantly longer than one would expect from an airport of this size. Further signage and direction finding must be improved. There were several information points around the airport that would have probably been helpful if there had been anyone at them.

There is not much in the way of signage both inside and outside the airport grounds and it can be confusing. The whole airport needs a rethink in terms of staff attitude towards passengers together with more signage. The TSA agent on arrival was quite pleasant and we were on our way into Manhattan within 40 minutes of arrival. Our luggage was already on the carousel. For departures BA's check in area is located in the basement area of Terminal B; the signage by the roadside indicating where this is indicated is very small and needs to be made a lot bigger. In Terminal B there is small food court with a McDs. There is also a Chilis Too which is located nearer to the security checkpoint. Again there are no signs to indicate the existance of Chilis Too. TSA people on departure were slow and officious to the nth degree. There did not seem to be much effective communication between the TSA and the other security group who work in that airport; what we did see were these two groups arguing with each other about a wheelchair going through a security checkpoint (the wheelchair did not fit through the TSA checkpoint).,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,G Burns,NA,2009-07-21,Have used Newark two or three times a year most recently DUB-EWR-DTW on Continental. The airport has some positives - the monorail (Air Tran) fairly fast and easy. (There’s also a inter-terminal bus through the ugly underbelly of the airport – fast but hot little seating difficult for people with even minor mobility problems.) But echoing some of the other posts arriving internationally then connecting domestically is a zoo. Passengers have to do the work of baggage handlers in taking their bags after clearing customs into a snake line to a transfer point for rechecking onto domestic connections. There are not enough airport workers nor enough space nor enough explanatory signs for this transfer; passengers are confused and herded like cattle. There’s no indication that it’s occurred to the airport authorities that international arrivals involves some people who don’t speak English. Even well intentioned airport workers – clearly not trained to deal with international passengers - end up barking orders that even English speakers have trouble hearing and understanding. One is expected (again without any clear explanatory signs) to deposit one’s bags in one of the jumbled piles of luggage. It’s such a picture of chaos that no reasonable person would think that those bags will end up checked onto the appropriate destination. Thus the crowding gets worse as passengers are understandably hesitant to separate from their bags. TSA in Newark can be unbelievably slow. First why can’t the whole transfer from an international flight to a domestic connection be in a secure area so that passengers don’t have to clear security again? In any case my TSA line literally cleared no more than about one passenger a minute; some people surely missed their flights.

You have to guess on your own whether the one to the left or one to the right will depart. And on top of that for no apparent reason you had to change the tram at terminal A to go to terminal B. Nothing tell you do so. You just have to guess seeing most of the people getting off the train. It was very confusing. The gate number for my flight was not listed even though flight was about to depart in less than an hour. Security had to be the slowest of any airport I have seen. Its not that there were lot people ahead of me - the TSA folks just looked lazy and clumsy thats all. They didn't have any incentive to expedite people faster.

There's a Hungry Jack's burger outlet which provides standard fast food fare - probably the best food value in the airport because their prices are the same as any other Hungry Jack's outlet and not inflated by the airport location. The ""Insomnia"" coffee bar was charging between $3.50 and $5 for a long black coffee - not cheap in my opinion. There's a water fountain right next to the entrance to the toilets so most people would probably pay $3 to a vendor for a bottle but to be fair - there is a water fountain. The check in desks only specify the airline and don't have details of flights. So it's possible to wait 20 minutes in line only to be told ""We're not checking in that flight yet come back at 4.40 pm"" (but that's after no effort has previously been made to communicate this information to people in the line).

Well that's not quite the case here. There are two major irritations. Security is the most zealous I've encountered anywhere bar none. Been here twice both times called in to have main suitcase rifled through. A lot of elderly holidaymakers who are not used to taking off shoes belts and so on - this can create very slow moving lines at security - answer why not PUT UP SOME SIGNS to advise them of this while we all fester in the queue? Once they finished with me then they go through my 4 year old's bag of toys vaguely peering at them shaking them etc. how depressing. Second problem is the compulsory £5 departure tax paid for via some hastily re-jigged car par ticket machines. Again security don't let you through without your voucher but so many pax fail to realise this till it's too late - heaven knows this must produce some conflict with beered-up travellers in the height of summer! Because there are so few check-in desks they only open check-in 45 mins before departure time so DON'T go arriving early or you'll have to sit with your luggage which can get awkward given lack of space landside.

The guy took my money wrote out my receipt and prepared a little plastic 'credit card' for me to use for entry and exit. When I asked why my expiry date was shown as '31st March 2013' he explained that all parking contracts have to start on the first day of the month so despite the date of purchase being 26th Oct my pass had to start on 1st October. Furthermore there was an additional 20 euro fee to issue the card! My other memory of Nimes is the airport restaurant. Service there was so sloppy and slow that despite having nearly two hours available it was never possible to eat all of your rather poor quality overpriced 3 course meal without missing your flight. Other gripes - The little newspaper / book shop closed in 2010 and has only recently reopened I would say in summary that I only use Nimes Airport if I have to.

There are very few food options (for some reason they are all outside the terminal so, so you'd have to eat before going through security if you want something edible. The person who gave me my lackluster bagel was very rude and mumbled the whole exchange. The prices at the food places are even more exorbitant than expected.

When we returned to the airport we went through to departure lounge. We were due to fly at 1.35pm at 5.30pm we were informed that we were to be bussed to Stansted for a flight at 2.35am. My issue is with what happened next there was no organisation to load buses cases were just dumped in the check in area and we were left to find buses when they arrived it was a free for all. When you have children with you you feel under pressure to try and sit with them. We bought some food for the journey in the airport which was expensive only to be given the same when on the coach would have been helpful to relay this earlier this would have saved us spending more money.

norwich-airport,/airport-reviews/norwich-airport,Norwich Airport customer review,R Brook,United Kingdom,2013-01-17,Norwich Airport is the most half hearted operation imaginable. Commercial passengers are given the impression that they are a bit of a nuisance and attempts to keep their numbers to a minimum with the £10 service charge high car parking charges minimal choice of destinations and a generally apathetic air have been remarkably successful. The lack of arrivals or departures does not result in a speedy check in and the airport is liable to close if weather conditions are anything less than ideal.

We used it just for one arrival so did not use check-in facilities restaurants etc. It did take some time for baggage to arrive at the carousel but whether this is normal we don't know.

Yes the airport is small crowded noisy old and unimpressive looking. But I had no problems or delays with my flights. Checking in was OK.

oakland-airport,/airport-reviews/oakland-airport,Oakland Airport customer review,M Moore,NA,2004-11-28,I spent four years in Oakland before moving out of California recently and did most of my domestic travel out of OAK. Oakland offers several advantages over SFO. Its East Bay location makes it easy to get into San Francisco assuming traffic on the Bay Bridge isn't at a standstill. There are fewer fog-related delays and cancellations at OAK than SFO. Airfares tend to be a bit lower at OAK as well. In terms of size the Oakland Airport is manageable and reasonably convenient; you can be off the plane and out the front door in a matter of minutes. If you time your arrival and departure well it's a snap to get in and out. The biggest problem is that the other seven or eight million people in the Bay Area have also figured these things out. Fly at a peak time and the traffic jams on the access road can be daunting. Ditto the queues at the security checkpoints. There is ostensibly a BART station but the shuttle bus gets stuck in the same traffic jams which sort of defeats the purpose of using mass transit. (The new direct rail shuttle over to the main BART line will remedy this situation when it's built.) And the facilities themselves are on the tattered side. Renovation is underway but I'd like to see a better range of dining options and cleaner restrooms. Decent carpet and more electrical outlets for laptops and cell phone recharging would be great too. Overall I enjoy the experience of being in SFO more now that I don't live in the region -- vastly better food plus the convenience of the Airtrain and the on-site BART station the cleanliness and more comfortable facilities give it an edge over Oakland. I'm willing to risk weather-related delays and longer security lines for these amenities. Most of the time anyway.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Our flight was the second of the three to arrive that day from the UK and by the time this flight had started to line up a couple more desks had opened. The blame for that lies with the CBP so this is out of the hands of the airport management. Baggage was again placed on the floor of the carousels for people to find once immigration formalities were completed.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,Steve Koenig,NA,2009-01-13,"A modern relatively comfortable airport. Also extremely busy with many families starting or ending holidays there which adds to the chaos in the check-out lines (lots of overweight baggage on the way out and far too few attendants at least at Delta). After checking in getting your bags weighed etc. you need to take all of your bags to a security area to leave them off for scanning (agents said to just leave our bags and leave which seemed to defeat the purpose of security; also not clear what would prevent one from adding items to their luggage to get around weight restrictions). Security line was relativey quick for us but have heard it can be very busy. Plenty of options for shopping and dining but far fewer once you go through security and take at train to your individual terminal. Returning a rental car can be a bit confusing since some companies have their return facilities next to the terminals (need to walk) and some are off-airport.

The PMI pages on the AENA website were a useful guide to what type of assistance we could expect but when we actually landed at Palma my wife needed to stretch her legs after 2 hours of sitting and so we walked slowly from the gate instead of waiting for one of the 7 wheelchairs which would have been needed for our particular flight. For our return journey we did use the PRM facilities which didn't work quite as smoothly as those at LPL. None of the special call points around the airport seemed to be operative so we had to report to the information desk in the centre of the check-in area for assistance to be summoned. We then had a wait of perhaps 15 minutes before assistance arrived a form was filled in (with copy attached to the wheelchair) and we were then taken to the special security area for PRM passengers. There appeared to be a relay system after security but we were allowed to make our own way to the gate rather than wait for the next available ""pusher"". And yes we did have the gate number long before it appeared on the screens for everyone else. A delay to our flight resulted in a Belfast flight being allocated to our gate and more wheelchair handlers arrived ready to assist PRM passengers onto that flight so we quickly had to explain that we weren't going to Belfast! One of the handlers was good enough to ring through to ask for the new gate for the LPL flight and even to wheel my wife to it. When eventually our flight was called PRM passengers were the first to board with more handlers to wheel them along the airbridge to the door of the plane. Unfortunately my wife's ""pusher"" talked loudly on his mobile phone most of the time leaving only one hand free to steer the chair and failing to avoid the bumps! The only time when he came off his mobile phone was when he saw an associate some 20 yards away down the airbridge and had a shouted conversation with him. My wife was glad to board the plane! So though PMI has a clearly defined system for PRM passengers its operation was not as smooth or efficient as we had hoped though no one was actually unhelpful. We didn't see any of the motorised buggies which used to transport PRM passengers so efficiently in the past but perhaps they are reserved for passengers being taken to the more distant gates as on this occasion we flew into and out of area A. As for PMI itself it was less busy than we've seen it on some occasions and there were few queues....but then we bypassed the main security area.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-01-26,I know my name already appears several times for comments on PMI but a January transit provided a completely different experience from any of our previous visits. It was pretty quiet when we arrived on a Saturday morning after a long taxi round to area D though there was a queue at passport control as 2 flights ex-UK arrived almost simultaneously. Departing on a Tuesday morning though was positively eerie: the place was almost deserted and at security there were just 4 staff and 2 of us! I've never seen an airport so quiet. Yet even with only 3 flights departing during our 2 hours there we still had to wait a while before our gate number appeared on the screens. I can't understand the reluctance of airports to announce the designated gate well in advance because the staff who take wheelchair passengers to their departure points always seem to know which gate long before the number is displayed on the screens. Despite checking in online I even had to go to an easyJet desk (also deserted apart from the staff) simply to find out which area (D again) to head for after security.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-11-05,Surprised to find how busy Palma was midweek halfway through October (not even UK half term week). Both inward and outward flights involved bus transfers from/to remotish stands and through area A which was fairly crowded. We were told on our return flight that one runway was closed so perhaps all flights were concentrated to just part of the airport. The result was shorter walks but busier concourses. Perfunctory passport control on arrival long queues at security on departure though the queues did move reasonably quickly. Even so some people had to queue-jump presumably to avoid missing their flights. Also there were lots of flight calls for named passengers who had failed to board on time. PMI is a very big and busy airport and you need to allow for this if you want to reach your gate on schedule.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Easyjet flights seem to be using area C again after being in area A for a while so it meant we were back to the extra long cross-airport hikes. No delays at passports in either direction and quite swiftly through security on the return journey. We didn't have to take our watches off this time but there were notices advising that certain types of footwear would have to be removed e.g. ladies full length boots. The only minor hiccup was that our return flight to Liverpool seemed to be omitted from some of the screens which could have been difficult for passengers who had checked in online. Quite a few of the food outlets were not yet open but otherwise the airport seemed to be functioning efficiently.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2007-04-30,An airport for the energetic because of the huge distances to be covered from arrival gate to baggage reclaim or from check-in to departure gate. Everything seems to work well but there could be more lifts because access from car parking/car hire collection or return to check-in usually involves going up or down one floor with a laden trolley. Transfer of less mobile passengers is usually efficient but on our return journey from Palma to Liverpool yesterday the two elderly and less mobile members of our party were deposited at the wrong location and I had to start searching for them! Luckily I found them fairly quickly but it could have been a real problem. Security is thorough and slow moving: even wrist watches have to be removed. Passport control en route to departure gates was also slow yesterday: two queues 50 yards or more in length gradually combining into one with just one man to inspect the passports. All in all you need to allow plenty of time to make your way from check-in to departure gate: 30 -45 minutes at least.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

papeete-airport,/airport-reviews/papeete-airport,Papeete Airport customer review,Harun Rathore,NA,2005-03-31,Arrived at and departed from PPT on a two-week Easter holiday. Some of the older comments are indeed true. Some need explanation. It is true that the immigration for non-FP and non-EU-nationals takes a while but it is nothing compared to the ordeals you sometimes have to go through when arriving in the USA. (I know what I am talking about. I had to cahnge in LAX before going to PPT.) The staff at PPT is overall very friendly – even at night – there is a little band to welcome you with traditional Tahitian music. The airport employees do not usually grunt the problem simply is the following: If you arrive at Tahiti and you do not understand French you are as lost as a person coming to the UK or the USA with little or no knowledge of English would be. However when you leave PPT to return back home  you have to pass ONE security control (screening of all your luggage and your body) before you can check in your luggage then you have to leave the security area for some reason no one was able to explain. You pass through a door and are once again in the airport’s main hall. You then have to go through passport control and have to go through ANOTHER security control where they screen your carry-on luggage and your body again. After that you arrive in the departure lounge. The latter can be crowded if two planes depart at the same time but there is one more public waiting room on the second floor and that was surprisingly empty. Very few passengers seemed to go there because the signs only read Airport Lounge. When it comes to boarding before you leave the terminal to walk out to your plane there is a THIRD security check.

Check-in even in the face of multiple Thomson flights was very quick. The security queue was long but moved steadily. I think they're making quite an effort in the departure lounge and I thought lunch entirely satisfactory if expensive. There were a number of facilities and the outside seating area is very pleasant and would be much more so if all the smokers were removed. It seems to me that the number of transfer buses is inadequate so that when the Thomson peak gets going it is hardly possible for them to the load the outbounds and unload the inbounds very effectively.

This is pretty old fashion airport so do not expect jetways fontains or wifi hotspots but fairly enough for easy transport means and connections. Swift immigration no checked baggage so headed for the Orlyval train in 10 mins after landing. The only point is one (!) counter for train tickets - fairly too few to manage todays traffic at the peak times (there are another two ticket machines accepting banknotes or credit cards as well). Departing on Thursday mid-evening easy navigation to the check-in though you have to slalom between some queues sometimes. Two counters for an 737 flight just okay staff friendly and working fast. Reaching the departure hall is a matter of walking steps up and down (due to the reconstruction) first you can reach understaffed passport control (3 out of 8 counters open) security just before the respective hall (was forced to remove my belt on the other side nobody cared the liquids in my x-rayed bag). This may be a stuck point so beware you slower movers and take some 30 mins to reach the G hall. Tried to buy some drink before security to take with but shops did not offer the security pack (I wonder if they would when purchasing a bottle of wine or scotch?). Airside there was just one small snack bar and one delights shop there. A lack of seating for a full plane pax load waiting at the gate. A bit chaotic gate staff changed by PA the gate number their english was from terrible (rather a nose sounds than words) to non-existent (only French announcement for passengers to another international destinations).

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,R Lubbers,United States,2012-06-04,Easily the worst airport we had to navigate on an around-the-world itinerary. Arrival on Air France wasn't too bad with only a modest delay in baggage arrival. Departing on British Airways was unpleasant. The airport bus could not drop us at 2A due to construction so dropped us on the other side of the airport requiring us to heist our luggage. The path was extremely poorly marked. Terminal 2A is dark looks as though it is 40 or even 50 years old lengthy lines at some airline check-in spots. Had a pleasant quick check-in at BA had a short line for security (business class) but the check-in area was extremely warm and the security area even warmer. Personnel were reasonably pleasant and courteous however. Some of the gate areas were pleasant and cool - why couldn't the rest of the airport be equally well air-conditioned? We had no real options as we wanted to include Paris in our itinerary but I would go out of my way to avoid CDG in the future.

After reading many negative reviews of this airport we were not looking forward to it. However we were very pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. Check-in was a breeze allowing people who have checked in online to proceed straight to a bag drop counter. This worked very well unlike Sydney where it doesn't seem to be of any advantage to check-in online. All staff we encountered were smiling and pleasant and spoke English if required. Passport control and security were thorough polite and no slower than any other airport I have encountered. The shopping area has everything required and is reasonably calm and pleasant again unlike Sydney which is like a noisy Westfield shopping centre.

Although more light reaches the upper level the terminal lower level is gloomy. The walking distances are unbelievable; we took a shuttle train within 2E and still had considerable walks in the same terminal and subsequently from baggage claim to RER station. Baggage arrived at a carousel other than that advertised on the plane's information screen. I did not see any master screen to direct one to the correct carousel.

The so-called architecture of this airport is an insult to those passengers that have to use this disgrace of a labyrinth that should be demolished and rebuilt from scratch.

In order to get to Concourse F you have to use a downward escalator - there were too many people going to that area at the time I was there so there was a very long line (Disney-style!) to go down the escalator waiting for buses. Once the line started moving the person who was supposed to control the flow of humanity completely failed because too many people were queuing up at the base of the escalator and people were stopping at the bottom! There would have been a pileup if I hadn't said loudly ""Move move move move move!!"" and people at the bottom moved. But she completely failed.

However on return to PHL plane arrived at Terminal A but (as is procedure) bags are sent to Terminal B. Saw no signs indicating how to get from Terminal A to Terminal B. When we finally realized we were ""lost"" we asked the Info Desk. She told us we had to walk outside to get to Terminal B. Having come from PR we were in only shirtsleeves and it was 19 degrees out!

portland-airport,/airport-reviews/portland-airport,Portland Airport customer review,M Atkinson,United States,2014-09-28,"There's a lot of bad and good to say about Portland International Airport. First the good: PDX has a lot of restaurants and shops to visit. Prices aren't too outrageous and it feels organized and easy to navigate. I've read a lot of complaints about the TSA in Portland but I've experienced very few problems especially compared to other airports. The lines usually move fast and they don't make me remove all my liquids from my luggage which some airports do. Now the bad: the pick up for PDX is a mess. It doesn't need to be but it really is. First of all is the smoking problem. Everywhere along the pick up line are signs that say ""No Smoking."" There is a designated smoking area at the very start of the line where cars come in. However whenever I'm at PDX there are smokers standing all over the place in any location along pick up. I have yet to see PDX enforce them. The second issue with pick up is that there are signs posted everywhere asking people to not wait. That's why there is a very useful easy to find cellphone waiting area nearby. However often the pick up lane will be entirely blocked with parked cars who are still waiting for people to get out of baggage claim or off their flights. I've watched multiple cars sit in the same spot for over fifteen minutes while the drivers played on their cell phones. On many occasions I've picked up and been picked up at this airport and if anything I've always seen cars blocking the entire pick up line with no one in sight to pick up. There was no one to enforce the many signs stating this was illegal. It's been a problem several times which is why I'm finally writing about it. Weekends are the worst and I usually try to avoid that but sometimes that's impossible. Let's use common sense PDX! I can understand giving people a few minutes so the person being picked up can run to the car from wherever they were waiting outside and drop their luggage in the trunk but anything over five minutes to fifteen plus minutes is ridiculous.",NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

While it was nice to have the consolidated rental car facility near the terminal with no shuttle bus required finding the correct entrance was a bit confusing. As noted having a light rail station adjacent to the station is a definite plus (about 45 min to the area of downtown where we were staying) though we had so many bags we did not use it. Although I had read that taxis to downtown cost about $30 we were told at the airport they would cost about $45 and so used one of the shuttle vans costing about $14 per person (usable for downtown only). There are several hotels and shopping malls near the airport. I agree that the road immediately in front of the terminal is crowded and chaotic. Use caution when talking out to the center island for courtesy vans (eg. for hotels).,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Luggage arrives within a few minutes much better than in Warsaw. The green City Transit Authority buses to the city center stop just outside the new ""L"" line is the fastest option. Bus ticket costs 260 PLN and should be bought at the RUCH shop at the terminal exit and then validated immediately onboard the bus. The ""L"" bus goes to the main railway station with a few stops enroute but as in Warsaw the journey takes a long time in peak traffic.

He actually warned me that in my vicinity there are 3 infants and if I'd like to change. I agreed. All with a smile. Passport control took al about 3 seconds to go through. The security check is at each gate and for the first time all with broad smiles and efficient - took a lot from the usual departure jitters.

Flying Czech airlines from T2. Even at 5.45am the hall was full and seemed like a rush hour of sorts. There were check-in kiosks all over the place and each had a lady helping the passengers easing the crowds from actual check in and just sending them afterwards to baggage drop off. I found this really attentive. After being there for 20 minutes the crowds eased as more and more check in counters opened and the crowds dispersed- at the beginning it looked a bit messy. Check in went through fast enough then through x rays which is also quick enough. Coming into the terminal air side at 6am many shops were still closed but a fair amount was open. The Czech Pub type restaurant was very big and a lot to chose from. Prices were OK. Eating venues prices seem to be represented in various ""price star"" category as shown in the guide that is available. Went to my gate as we were bussed to our plane (An ATR turboprop). It was painfully cold that day outside so it was very sweet of the bus driver to open and close the door when we were waiting for the rest of the passengers to step in the bus compared to other airports where doors are wide open no matter what weather is outside. Prague is still a great airport and very easy to navigate through. You have what you need there. I have to be fair and take one star for the relative mini-chaos that was at the check in the morning. I agree that it is not an airport to remain in while long lay-overs so I guess either use one of the hotels around the place and in the air-side as well or just jump to the city as its only 30 minutes away.",NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

When arriving to Pristina we had to walk all the way to the arrival hall which in my opinion looks very old. Baggage took a long time to get to the baggage carousels and they were on the wrong carousel. They were on the carousel for a Swiss flight instead of where they should've been. Staff were very helpful helped us to take the bags down from the carousel and explained to us that there was a misunderstanding between the staff. But one bad thing is that they didn't bring baggage carts so we had to carry the baggage all the way to the car waiting for us but the walking distance to the parking is really short so frankly it was not a big deal. When departing there were enough baggage carts and the whole check-in process and everything worked pretty smoothly and fine.

Quick check in and security control pleasant enough cafe and two shops with local produce and the best of all- the outdoors observation area at the top of the waiting hall. What spoiled the perfect arrival/departure? As per usual ""Europe's largest low cost airline"" started announcing boarding despite the arriving flight was not even near the Croatian airspace. Me and my partner decided against standing in the queue until at least arriving plane was in our sight but this was prevented by member of staff shouting at us (at the observation deck) that we should proceed through the boarding gate (reminder - inbound flight did not arrive for another 20 minutes).

A very small airport that can hardly cope with the amount of passengers who use it. Were brought by bus to the small ""Schengen"" arrival hall. The forty passengers of our flight were almost too many for the luggage vonveyor belt. I wonder how they manage aeroplanes of the size of a Boeing 737 let alone an Airbus! In the departure hall they have approximately ten check-in counters which seemed quite enough for a Sunday afternoon. The ""Schengen"" departure lounge after passing the security check however is hardly adequate. There were only two departures at that time an ATR 72 (70 seats) to Munich and a Boeing 737-500 (120 seats) to Luxemburg. These two were already two many for the few seats they have in the departure lounge. Moreover there is almost nothing you can do. There is an overpriced restaurant a an equally pricey souvenir shop.

Terminal 2 newer and being expanded to handle all international flights but fewer facilities in terms of eateries and shops especially outside security (need to make the very long walk to Terminal 1 or try to get a ride on one of the golf carts going between the two).

Saw almost no signage for arriving international passengers on where to go for connections to domestic flights.

Terminal 2 is marginally better being newer but facilities are very poor (one coffee shop around departure gates) seats are uncomfortable PA is risibly incomprehensible both in English and Portuguese thanks to dreadful acoustics.

I caught the train from Termini, it is a bit faster but not really worth the extra expense and it's a long walk from the station to T1. The self-service check-in did not work and the queue for desks was very long indeed, a nice member of staff suggested that with hand baggage I should go through security and act as a transfer passenger which worked except they could not allocate me a seat. The gate was being used for another flight and as soon as that finished boarding staff disappeared. The replacement appeared with about 30 minutes to departure and several of us waiting to be allocated seats. He was very distracted, dealing with one person and then walking away, the same with boarding, he would check half a dozen on and then do something else (to be fair he was alone but it was very inefficient and frustrating). We were boarded on a bus, there appeared to be only one so we had to wait while it went and came back. Once on board we waited for 10 minutes while nothing happened, on a very hot day.

This turned out to be of no value time wise. The woman at the bag drop sat and chatted with a colleague while the queue grew. She did nothing. When she finally opened up her desk we had lost half an hour. She told us we were over weight on one bag. It had been underweight on the flight we had just come in on. We took out one jacked which made the difference. Then she told us we had to hurry, our departure gate was about to close. We rushed to our departure gate only to find our flight was actually delayed for an hour. When that gate opened, there were two people at two check in desks. These two chatted and laughed with a third who subsequently left. They carried on with their conversation while the crowd grew and fumed. There was no order, no lines. The guy, officious at best, started to take the 'fast track' passengers first. This took about 20 minutes before they began to accept the rest of the passengers. At the moment I am at Heathrow.

I was yesterday in the immigration queues with about 100 people and even though there were supposed to be EU and non EU queues people were moving in and out in between them jumping shoving pushing trying to get information there was no staff present no appropriate signage and to add insult to injury the passport control only spoke Italian.

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,B Thompson,United Kingdom,2012-04-09,Big problems at the check-in desk as they would not accept the online boarding passes and everyone had to go through the laborious process again by two very slow operatives. A very long queue and no concessions made for passengers needing assistance. This of course delayed the flight. Only a number of hasty phone calls prevented further ructions at the departure gate when all hand luggage passengers with online boarding passes were initially refused entry onto the plane. Don't know whose fault this was Monarch or the airport and I have to say Monarch were excellent in every other respect.

Departing if flying BA be prepared for a long walk! Security was very busy and cramped. They insist that phones cameras and MP3 players are removed from hand luggage.

Not enough restaurants and chaotic. Train connection: Too expensive. (40 euro for 2 adults / 3 children) bus is cheaper.

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,John Oram,United Kingdom,2011-02-11,My recent experiences broadly reflect those already posted except that of Alan Mackenzie who was presumably at a different airport one which actually does have light airy modern buildings. If there is one adjective to describe FCO it is tired; another is chaotic. Our arrival via shuttle and a long walk neither of which is unusual for a major airport today saw us through passport control with ease. There was a slightly protracted wait for baggage in a hall whose ceiling seems low although it is not particularly so. More hiking takes one from the baggage claim area to the faintly anarchic and poorly signposted outside. Few concessions are made to those pushing trolleys (carts) as seems likely at an airport and sightlines are poor. It is clear that many of the taxi drivers are illegal or at least unofficial and one feels for a moment that one might be slightly further south. Tempted by the train we tried first to get the cheaper coach shuttle only to find that the one on stand was destined for the entirely inconvenient Ostiense Station. We went for the train after all the amusingly named Leonardo Express which at speeds varying between 40 and 60 km/h (indicated on a moving map) makes less than express progress through graffiti land to Termini. People choosing this route should be aware that the train arrives at the remarkable Platform 28 which is about 1000m short of the main concourse area (and taxis). I was frankly astonished when the man selling train tickets at FCO tried to sell me alternative coach shuttle tickets with the explanation that this alternative went to the concourse area. He may have had a good heart but I cannot imagine that his sideline had any kind of official sanction. Our return to FCO was unremarkable. A taxi ride from the centre is sufficiently frightening to diminish considerably any fear of flying. The check in area was again 'tired' but efficiently operated and security was smooth and pleasant. Directions to the boarding gates are poorly signposted. We saw little of the rest as we hid in the BA lounge. There is pier construction on the north side of the terminal complex which is evidence at least of intent to improve. I did notice however during our weekday stay that no-one seemed to be actually constructing anything.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Baggage areas are good if you like being with many people trying to get their baggage in a very small area. The wait times for baggage can be long but this waiting time does give you the opportunity to reflect on how old and dirty many parts of this airport are and wonder how the airport administration allowed this to happen. The airport does have many excellent cafes but be sure to have a coffee before flying out from the many gates which lack proper seating and are very overcrowded as you wait for your often delayed Alitalia flight.

The train connecting arrivals to baggage collection was crowded as only one was working. Baggage arrival very slow. There was a large queue at passport control as their signposting is unclear as to who should be in what queue. The return journey was better we did self service check-in at the BA desk and it was then very quick through security and to the departure lounge. We used the flightplan lounge which was ok but fairly busy. Their duty free shops are not too bad and staff were helpful.

If you are arriving with checked luggage expect delays for it to arrive on the carousel. However last week with roll-on bags we breezed through with lots of time to make the Leonardo Express to downtown. It appears that FCO management does have any interest in cleaning as the place is filthy and badly maintained - at any time of the day or night.

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,Ed Smith,NA,2007-08-08,"The train connection from Rome Termini is good quick efficient and reasonably cheap (11 Euros) with a short walk from the platform to the departures area. After that easy experience what follows it is hysterically bad. Check-in in Terminal C at least is a horrendous experience due to the abysmal layout of the check in areas - I can only assume they were designed by someone who never uses airports or who has severe masochistic tendencies. For some reason the check in desks are split into ""zones"" - each zone occupies a square with an area of approximately 50 metres square with approximately 12 check in desks in the square 6 either side of the square - as a result of this the queues for each desk meet in the middle in a horrendous muddle of confusion. To add to this the passport/security line also runs through the middle of all of this! The result therefore is that you have something like 13 different queues in a very small area working in 3 different directions - most passengers with heavy luggage often with children running around and screaming. If like me you are trying to get to a check-in desk near the back of this area you will find that you literally have to elbow your way through a seething mass of grumpy humanity and baggage to get to it - and then trying to find the end of your own queue is another matter -in the end I had to shout out loudly for people going to my destination to identify themselves so that I could join the correct queue. Once through all this the passport/security line is reasonably fast when compared to many airports (10 mins) although I would say that the actual inspections are a little on the cursory side. Airside the airport is at least a little more spacious although the airport authorities have not deemed it necessary to fill this space with useful furniture such as adequate seating. Proceeding to the gate to board in plenty of time I was amazed to see that the gate was being used to board 3 other flights before mine - although my plane was sitting waiting on the tarmac we simply could not get to it as the gate was being used for these other flights - this tells me that this airport simply does not have adequate capacity to deal with the volume of flights going through it - and this was on a Wednesday early afternoon not exactly peak time. Put simply this airport is a disgrace and needs an overhaul if it is to continue being the primary international gateway to Italy.",NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Transfer from C Staellite to baggage was smooth but we had a very long wait for our bags and after only one delivery of BA bags we started being drowned in Air Canada. I had to protest in poor Italian to restore the BA bags which then came in a torrent. However there had been a handling problem at LHR so all the fault might not have been at FCO. Good signposting to rail station and on time train though I would think they could do with better than 1/2 hr frequency. Word of warning to the hard of moving the train comes in at Platform 27 at Termini station and that is a good 400m from the concourse as it is a short platform. The environment at FCO was pleasant and seemed uncrowded although on the return journey Terminal C seemed a bit gloomy and looked its age. Loads of shops and conspicuous cleanliness. Security had a light handed (but not inadequate) touch. Basically the friendliest I have experienced since 9/11.

Security staff were more interested in chatting amongst themselves than paying attention to passengers. Food options poor with shelves barely stocked. Toilets (air-side) smelt revolting and needed a deep clean. Staff in the duty-free shop were eating their lunch at the counter also chatting amongst themselves while 'serving' me. Overall the staff throughout the entire airport didn't seem to care. The plus side is it's a small airport and the queuing was almost non-existent.

Arrivals area contains an information desk which provided useful information on onward connections and provided me with change for the bus travel recommendations and a complementary city map. Bus number 33 leaves from virtually outside arrivals and takes approx 20 minutes to reach Rotterdam Central. It costs 3 euros at the time of writing and the driver has limited change. On the return journey there was no queue for check-in and virtually no queue for security. This is a small airport but there are decent airside facilities including a duty free shop cafe newsagent and an upstairs bar (which has an outdoor seating area and viewing platform). If you are travelling with BA there are no lounge facilities but you are allowed three complementary items from the airport cafe (for which you will need to complete an information card). Clear information throughout the terminal and announcements in English and in Dutch. Free Internet in departures which was fast and required no password.

SLC airport is very small and obviously just a regional airport. Two best options for getting to downtown are a UTA bus for $2.50 or a free shuttle provided by the Mormon church. The Mormon shuttle will take anyone of any religion to downtown and collect them later in the day and take them back to the airport free of charge. The only catch is you have to do a tour of the Temple Square complex which takes about 40 minutes and involves being guided by two young female missionaries. This tour is excellent but will involve your own religious beliefs being inquired about which I didn't mind but others may want to consider this. Airport itself is only 15 minutes from downtown unlike in most cities where it is some distance away. Airport had good stores albeit rather small. TSA staff were genuinely charming and helpful.

san-jose-airport,/airport-reviews/san-jose-airport,San Jose Airport customer review,B Scott,NA,2010-03-28,Be aware - after security there is no place to change money. If you have more leftover colones than you want to spend (which can be challenging to figure out since ALL prices after security are in dollars) you have to hope that you can get change from colones in dollars as a helpful person at Church's fried chicken did for me. There is also no bar after security making spending colones more of a challenge. Well there is a bar but it is in the smoking lounge which is in the basement and is unair conditioned so unless you are a smoker who likes to sweat it's not really an option. All food options in the terminal are American. It's clean and spacious (except for the construction area) and the farther you are from the construction area the better the A/C works. Some gates require a bus ride. Check-in seemed chaotic but was faster if you had done e-check-in with TACA. The security area was cramped due to construction but it moved quickly. As of 3/20/10 you can pay the departure tax in colones or dollars - if you use a credit card it is treated as a cash advance so be careful. You have to pay the departure tax before you check in - your migration form is on the back of the receipt and you need to fill that out before you check in. I liked the airport when I arrived (although I couldn't find an ATM on the arrivals level - you may have to go upstairs) but much less impressed on departure.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

san-juan-airport,/airport-reviews/san-juan-airport,San Juan Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-11-18,An older largely uncrowded airport that seems to have the facilities you'd expect of a small-to-mid-size domestic airport. While arrival was easy departure was a bit of a pain for us due to the complete absence of baggage carts on the arrivals level either at the curb or inside. No skycaps except in the baggage claim area. And no apparent curbside check-in facility. This was a big factor since you have to first take your bags to a Department of Agriculture inspection area to be scanned then take them to your airline's check-in counter then take them to the x-ray security station. Line for TSA security was relatively short. Selection of eateries inside security was fine. Note to airport authorities: put some darn carts at the curb on the arrivals area!

san-juan-airport,/airport-reviews/san-juan-airport,San Juan Airport customer review,P Smith,Canada,2012-04-16,YYZ-SJU-EIS return. Does its best but is clearly well above its design capacity in terms of passenger volumes. Check-in is hampered by too little space between counters and the exit which results in chaotic snaking queues and no free space. This is particularly trying during cruise ship changeovers when passenger volumes are highest. Security screening is passable with fairly efficient staff. Airside services are ok for the Caribbean but there is little available space for seating in the waiting lounges. Clearing US customs here is easy as it is mostly small planes feeding in passengers. San Juan's principal advantage is the number of direct flights from North America and the extensive connections provided by local airlines like American Eagle Cape Air and Fly BVI.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Virtually no place so sit in the cavernous check-in hall. There are several kiosks for various airlines though not for all. For some (eg Avianca) you need to ask or know to walk to the 4-story office building next door. Very few dining options outside of security. For any shopping at all you need to wander over to the domestic wing where there are some small stores including a pharmacy. Saw no central location for info on transportation options into Santiago. There are two different companies offering busses but you need to talk with both to get full info on prices and options on where you can go.

Airport at least apart from T3 is older - not the best facilities. Poor selection of eateries especially once you pass security. Connecting from an international to domestic flight you really need to find your own way to the transit counter (not easy to find). As with all Brazilian airports when connecting from domestic to international even if your bags are transferred you need to leave the security area and check-in with your international airline. Contrary to what one earlier review states there are lots of ATMs in the airport. Signs in English and attendants speaking English are not as common as they should be but they are definitely present. There is Wi-Fi it appears you need to register and pay for it. I didn't try. No problems in Immigration baggage pick-up or customs. The fact that the airline I used in T2 (Delta) is apparently not among those international airlines moving to T3 saddens me. I used T1 for Gol domestic flights. Certainly not remodelled but it seems less crowded than in the past perhaps because of the opening of T3.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

GRU is the worst IMHO. The baggage claim area has go to be one of the worst-configured I've seen: little space between baggage carousels and that made worse by the fact that baggage carts (at least they're free) are stacked between the carousels. When crowds jam around a carousel after a large plane arrives chaos can ensue. If it's a hot day the lack of effective air conditioning makes things worse (what this will be like during the World Cup I don't know). After Customs we stood in a long line to check our bags for a connecting domestic flight. Then went upstairs through security (that was quick) and downstairs to a crowded departure gate serving two flights. Passengers were told to get on one of two buses depending on their destination. Then we all went to exactly the same remote terminal and waited again for our flights (at least there was air conditioning here).

The place is being refurbished for the WC in 2014 of course but remains a really depressing and badly run place. If your flight allows you to board on a walkway then you're lucky - if it involves a bus it's cattle class.

GRU is not dirty just dingy and dark. It does have elevators! But I agree food prices are very high especially for snacks (the Viena churrascaria is expensive but not as overpriced as a pao de queijo and a beer) queues are long (get here 3h before your flight) and unannounced gate changes make it hard to relax (check screens at boarding time and regularly afterwards if your flight is delayed). I think the comments here are by and large fair. GRU is not somewhere you would choose to spend time but its not a bad place just struggling to cope with more people than it was built for and showing its age.

seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-11-18,In general a modern clean comfortable airport.

The shuttles stop on the third level of the parking structure. No big deal unless you have lots of bags. If you're departing and are staying at an airport hotel you can ask the hotel to call the Port Authority for permission to drop you off at the curb at the arrivals level (note: permission must be asked maybe half an hour in advance and the permission applies only to those on the request so if others are on the bus they first go to the regular drop-off area and then the bus circles again to drop you off). The area for the courtesy buses is for a variety of such shuttles: those for both parking lots (public and commercial) and hotels. While there are signs showing where each type of bus stops (in 2-3 locations) they tend to group together (with those for commercial parking lots seemingly especially numerous) and you have to be alert and while standing on the curb may have to flag down the shuttle you want especially if it's for a hotel.

Immigration lines on arrival were pretty long and immigration officials were characteristically prickly. Airport transfer to downtown via shuttle buses was cheap ($12.50 one way) and efficient.

I saw no crosswalks across that road. To get to the main terminal you need to get to one of the elevators in the parking garages to take you to a skywalk (bridge) over the access road to the terminal then find a second elevator to go up to the departures level. We almost rented one of the baggage carts in the parking garage but were glad we used a skycap due to the confusing route to our check-in counter. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the check-in areas. As noted a bit of a walk to the security line (with special entrance for First Class passengers) then down 2 (more?) escalators to get to the train to the ""S"" terminal for our flight. We did get our exercise departing from this airport.",NA,NA,NA,5,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,Paul Browne,NA,2008-07-28,Admittedly this is the first time that I have transited Seatac but I found the process very onerous. Arriving on a Lufthansa flight from Europe and connecting with an AC flight to Vancouver - a process that took 3 hours! Immigration Control was slow and as Canadian citizens we were not advised that we could use the Areas 5 and 6 reserved for US citizens until we were well into the lineup. Once dealt with by a very pleasant officer we had to go thru TSA inspection which took a while by more pleasant officers (did u know that there were regulation sized plastic bags for your liquids??? I sure didn't!) and then had to take 3 count 'em three trains to get to the North Satellite where our Jazz aircraft departed from! And we only made it because of a helpful United Airlines employee - certainly not because of any useful signage! We probably wouldn't choose to travel via SEA again if we could help it it was far too stressful.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The infrastructure is excellent, the hallways vast, the planes on time. Everything runs with great efficiency. But Seoul destroys the experience with a nightmarish transfer desk. Even in the early hours of the morning there are hundreds and hundreds of travellers crowded into a vast coral of zig zagging lanes that go up to another security gate. There is no special line for frequent travelers, business class, the elderly or small children. Everyone is throw into the cauldron and it is dreadful. This kind of senseless blockade increases consumer anxiety as they try desperately to make a connecting gate. They took all my luggage apart and made me repack for no good reason.

April 3 flying back with CZ from PVG to SHE flight was delayed 4 hours. In fact all flights going north from PVG were delayed 3-4 hours whilst flights going south left on time so what is this? Another military exercise causing vast delays or another VIP landing in PEK and creating havoc in the skies? Could not blame CZ airplane was there crew was there etc. After boarding on time we were asked to deplane and go back to the waiting hall. Just sit and wait - no announcements then suddenly I saw that my gate was boarding again without any notice or announcement. As many other reviewers say there is nothing to do in PVG - no decent food and far too expensive. Long walks to the end of the terminal while other gates are empty I think they want you to walk past all those shops with bored sales staff and overpriced items.

Cons: Massive lack of English among staff. Poor/no food choices in terminals. Anything there is is overpriced and poor quality. At least there's Burger King in T2 but if BK is your best option you know you're in trouble. Note there's nothing decent before immigration either. Frequent buses and long walks. At least half the times I land I have to ride a bus. Other times we use gates that are as far as physically possible from immigration. Frequent delays. This is probably not the airport's fault and is due to the ever present mysterious ATC. Shopping/amusement options almost non-existent. There's a duty free shop which actually has pretty good prices on cigarettes alcohol and lotions and potions but is poorly organized and not very appealing. Wifi is intermittent and requires a Chinese cell phone number.

Long delays of 2.5 hrs while on the plane waiting to take off - due to ""air traffic control"" problems - but some local domestic flights were landing and taking off while we were waiting - seems priority is given to these and international flights are left to wait. - causing me to miss a connecting flight at London.

Transiting to Japan with a 7-hour stopover we were ushered to the transit desk which is not airline-specific. Due to the very common delays on Chinese flights the most pressing flights were dealt with first. Passengers were dealt with as if they were causing problems for the staff rather than trying to do something which is carried out with ease at most international airports. I was asked why I didn't have a boarding pass for the final leg of my journey which could not be issued in London because the airline could not issue it there. All very annoying. A 7-hour stopover was reduced to 5 hours just by standing in the queue at the transit desk. Staff can be seen chatting happily which is very unprofessional and adds to the stress when things are going so slowly anyway. Do not expect anyone to smile.

The spaces have ample natural light gardens along with affordable shops and activities while waiting. Changi is not a world-beating architectural masterpiece but it is a nice place to spend time. It provides a warm and inviting ambience that many more elaborate terminal designs (like Kansai and Hong Kong) fail to offer with their expansive hard surfaces and artificial materials. Now that the shabby budget terminal has been closed even LCC users can enjoy the fine facilities. Unlike major Australian airports Changi has not suffered from over-capacity since the arrival of A380 services in the past few years either.

Be sure to look up information about finding the correct ""OK Taxi"" service to get into town; the taxi desk agent was gruff but effective.

southampton-airport,/airport-reviews/southampton-airport,Southampton Airport customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2011-09-22,Flew to Edinburgh from Southampton Airport in September. It's very local to us so convenient but the growth in flights hasn't been matched by a growth in facilities. The airport will argue that it is investing and has enlarged the area of retail and catering space airside (which is true) but the queues into departures are now almost always longer than those I experience at Heathrow. This airport needs to speed up its investment if it wants to continue to grow and especially the airside space. Landside - the retail outlets are limited to one WH Smith which is really quite bad for an up-coming airport like Southampton. The other huge problem with this airport is its reliance on Flybe. Flybe operate an extensive network of routes to France and within the UK but has very few decent 'city break' destinations on offer so if you need to fly to places like Barcelona Rome Madrid Prague and Vienna you have to go to London. The airport can handle large aircraft (757s and 737s) so am not sure why it has failed to attract a competitor to Flybe which in my opinion is gradually whittling away all the competition it faces.

A few minor niggles this time again the time between the screen showing 'boarding' and a PA announcement calling for final boarding was very short indeed (3 mins - I am not exaggerating not enough time to walk from the coffee bar via the toilets). On return we had to wait on the aircraft as no buses were available (10 minutes) and the queue for immigration was also about 10 minutes (we were on the third of three aircraft arriving more or less together) however still far less than many other places I could mention.

Security staff efficient and good humoured. My only complaint is that from the screens changing to 'Boarding' to our names being read out over the PA for 'immediate boarding' was about 2 minutes not even time to walk downstairs from the coffee bar.

So often you find yourself walking for miles before you reach your gate - here it's up some stairs through security down some stairs and you're at the gate. Forget gate #98 - there are only about 6 gates. You're not made to walk past hundreds of shops - there are just three airside and the only ones you need in an airport; a cafe/restaurant a newsagent and duty free. The lounge is basic but does the job and given the nature of the airport and the fact that you do not need to spend long there it is sufficient.

As a father of 4 and a Stockholm resident Arlanda succeeds at most things (cleanliness security shopping play areas) but fails dismally at food and beverage pricing. On the plus side for children there are two play areas. Now where Arlanda fails is that it's almost impossible to get children's food either for eating or take-on- board at a decent price. My benchmark for this has always been Boots in the UK where there have £3.99 meal deal (air side) giving you a 500ml drink a double/triple sandwich and a sweet snack. In Arlanda it would be impossible to do this for less than £12 or SEK120. With 4 children and the no liquids rule at security the cost of feeding my children is about 10% of the cost of a budget flight for each of us. Things have been improved recently with the addition of a local fast food joint ""Max"" in T5. Come on Arlanda.

The terminal building is impressive and always clean with abundant natural light. This is due to the fact that it is split into 5 levels but the bulk of the main terminal area is under one roof. Check-in is uniformly speedy and the staff are polite and efficient. Queues at security are manageable and the move from landside to airside is always smooth. The facility itself is compact and easy to navigate. The Red Baron Cafe landside is the best option for dining as it offers the best choice airside slightly limited but adequate for an airport of its size. A bus ride to your aircraft on stand-off bay is almost guaranteed but STR does this day in-day out so they do it well and everything is efficiently co-ordinated. Connections to the city are readily available via the S-Bahn on the underground level. The black and yellow checked Expresso bus is a good option to get to nearby Reutlingen and surrounds and Expresso tickets are also valid for the Reutligen bus network.

Just returned from an overseas visit to Tokyo Hong Kong and Bangkok. Arriving back in Sydney on March 3 was by far the most excruciatingly painful difficult third world airport experience of the trip. There was nothing positive about the experience. The arrivals hall infrastructure is completely inadequate with thousands of arriving passengers queued up well back into the terminal. Half of the kiosks weren't working with the ones that were working with long painful queues. If you could successfully get the kiosk to work (I couldn't necessitating a 60 minute wait in a service queue) it was likely the smartgate wouldn't take the ticket.

With nobody to direct passengers through a non-descript doorway with a tiny sign we had 200 passengers wandering all over the airport looking for their luggage. I asked a staff member where we were supposed to be and in spite of wearing a radio he just said ""I don't know"" and walked away. Signage is unclear to an Aussie let alone a visitor so when you see a tourist join the wrong queue you could be a little understanding unless you work at the SYD airport in which case you roll your eyes and in your best condescending tone say ""madam.

Whereas Incheon is user friendly with plants vegetation and scenic photographs everywhere Sydney airport is as sterile as a dental surgery with no people friendly accents so suggest airport staff go to Seoul and find out what a world class airport looks like be educated and come back and do something to poor old Sydney airport. Also at Sydney every effort is made to remove cash from passengers and the owner/operators could again take note of Incheon where baggage trolleys are free as is terminal to terminal shuttles. Also at Sydney after leaving immigration to go to your gate duty free stores are so located that its impossible to get to the gate without going through a maze and then the gates are hard to find.

It is inconceivable to me that going from one terminal to another could be so inefficient and costly. There is no tram that runs between domestic and international terminals. Option #1 is a shuttle bus (called T Bus) that runs every 30 minutes (and not on a schedule). Passengers were queued up for this service and it isn't even free - there is a A$5.50 charge for what amounts to an inferior unreliable service. Option #2 is a city train (called Airport link) which also charges A$5 for transport between terminals. Option #3 is a taxi which we chose because of a reasonably tight connection. Fare was A$15 and after generous tip cost me A$20. I cannot think of another major airport in the world that does not offer high quality reliable comfortable free transport between terminals.

We arrived at our gate just as boarding began unable to take advantage of using the business class lounge for which we had paid. I have no quarrel with the intense security measures at TLV but I do have a quarrel with a totally inadequate number of staff to handle this many people within a short period of time.

Before getting to the terminal my passport was taken I have to open my luggage outside go throw metal detector and pack my things up again. Then waiting in a line before check in. They questioned every imagine things noticed all stamps of countries in passport where I have visited. Then was a luggage scan inside a huge machine I´ve never seen at any airports. Then friendly check in at desk. After that the delay began. At first passport control they put me for a side line. After waiting there 10min a lady comes yelling me that you should come here with Asians. Another 50min wait after Asian group they took another 20 European pax after me as their flight was scheduled earlier. After another 50min wait there in a same line I finally got in. My hand luggage was x-rayed again. They called more staff and I was questioned again why I was in Israel at which hotel. A lady took my passport and boarding cards and started to call authorities. Then I was escorted with all my things back to terminal hall for inspection. All my things including underwear and so on were put on the table for scan with those big blue ""tooth brushes"" and they even x-rayed my training short. Staff at this point were calm and polite. They took a batter from my camera tested it with my recharger they even did it to my iPhone checking if it really works. Then I was escorted away from hall leaving my cameras and some valuables almost unattended. In a room they searched all kind of possible weapons from my body. I heard behind the curtains when some woman was upset when they told her to take her bra off. They scanned my belt shoes iPhone. Then staff was frustrated and said that everything is ok that I can wear my clothes. Then back to the huge hall where I saw my clothes and valuables unattended at the table. They packed my luggage and said that my electric shaver and toothpaste don´t come with me to cabin they packed them to a fragile box. Then I was escorted to elevator waited there staff to pick my box checked in. Then they said there are no security checks for me IÂ´m ready to go. They escorted me again through those lines where I started and there was a final passport control. This all took 2.5 hours I had only 20min time to spend at Dan lounge.

With the Metro being built its potential will increase. But the airport - which is being expanded is really not geared to tourists and though above the standard of other Greek airports is inferior to what it needs to be particularly when compared to Athens. Public transport information is non-existant - the tourist office is shut most of the time and has no bus maps (Thessloniki only has buses for transport at the moment): the bus stop has most information in Greek (fine for me but for German and British travellers?). The runway is being expanded to take long haul aircraft and a new terminal is being constructed but the airport has to think it terms of being a hub with clear information if it is to compete for tourists + business travellers with Athens or Istanbul.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
tianjin-binhai-airport,/airport-reviews/tianjin-binhai-airport,Tianjin Binhai Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,The International Terminal seems and feels like a temporary after thought. There is a major expansion of another terminal building next door so maybe proper facilities may exist later. As it is the check in area is separated totally from the rest of the airport requiring everyone to show ID to walk through a door to go through a customs area before actually checking in for the back end of the row of counter. Then you retrace your steps to access the immigration area before the typically cramped security screening which only had two of the four points on duty leading to a long wait in line. Once through the main terminal area is obviously a temporary scenario by the way the duty free shop acts to block access to the other gates.

I don't know why these computers have the ""From xxx"" bit in China: you're in Tianjin (or wherever) so it's pretty obvious where the flight is from.

It was necessary to have my passport checked by an immigration officer who saw it was a US passport and waved me through without looking at it. The customs inspection was minimal. The baggage claim area is OK. When I checked in for my departing flight I found passengers were required to go through screening and customs inspection to enter the check-in area. It is possible to exit and go outside while awaiting boarding time after you check in. The street entrance to the airport is under construction and it is necessary to walk past the boarded-off areas to enter the terminal.

With some great connections to mainland Mexico and a couple of new discount airlines using the airport it is a great alternative to SAN. Only annoying bit is the lack of any decent food and beverage once you're through security. Over priced and average.

They service over 18 cities in Canada and the U.S. with connections to more than 80 international destinations. Billy Bishop is the hub for Porter Airlines. Unlike most other airports that service commercial airlines Billy Bishop imposes a 23.00 curfew for both take off and landing of traffic. If a flight is on route for landing and cannot land prior to 23.00 the flight will be diverted to another airport. Although this rule is known by the airline flights are not held back but simply fly passengers to the closest city. This happened to my young daughter on Jan 6 2014 during one of the coldest nights of the year. Unfortunately there was no communication to the public that the flight was diverted and my daughter was left without support. Her ride was waiting for her at Billy Bishop airport but with no agent even present we had no way of knowing her location. In this case she made her way via shuttle bus from the airport in Hamilton where the flight had been diverted to a downtown train station in Toronto (2AM) where she found a place to stay the night.

Overall it is a reasonably smooth experience for US-connecting passengers but there is room for improvement. First time I flew PIT-YYZ-CPH and it was fairly easy to find the express immigration counter the CBSA officer manning the booth was not terribly pleasant but I've come to expect such. Later on I came the other way NRT-YYZ-PIT. The express moving sidewalk from the plane to US pre-clearance was not terribly safe I was walking along at a brisk pace due to only having 80 mins. between flights when the walk suddenly slowed down without warning resulting in a huge pileup. Either tell people not to walk on the conveyor or do a better job of warning when it slows down. The fancy new automated passport scanners at US pre- clearance are a good idea in theory but I had to scan my passport 5 times before it finally worked.

One was all the good things about airport terminal design and the second was all the bad things. Unfortunately they mixed up the two lists when they drew up the designs. I cannot fathom how such a new terminal built at such great expense can be so inefficient. The worst part is trying to pass through customs after collecting your baggage.

In the last month I've flown through Pearson from LHR MUC and IST and without fail I'm amazed at our archaic customs process and the ridiculously long wait for baggage. I'm a Canadian citizen. I'm pleased they have a separate queue for Canadian Residents now however Canada is the only country I've been to (out of 47) that is the most onerous and frustrating to enter. The Canadian Residents line is always the longest the three flights I took also required us to use the automated machines that promote ""faster entry home"" - the kiosks were slow couldn't read my passport and the organisation was a mess. You then still have to join another queue and give your printout (a waste of more paper and tax dollars as it's a scanned copy of the form you just filled out) to an officer who may or may not ask you questions. You then join another queue to show more officers your printout - and then once you get your luggage (which even for Priority can take ages - I waited 50 minutes for my bag from IST - easily wait an average of 40 minutes) you have to queue yet again to give your printed form to another customs agent. If the airport isn't busy it's not so much of an issue but these times are rare particularly when you arrive from European flight - most arrive in the early evening and you then have thousands of people trying to get through. It's terrible and makes no sense - can't we at least get rid of one of those checkpoints? And Pearson/GTAA whomever please fix the ridiculously long wait times for luggage.

International flights connect in the same passport control room with people flying from Canada to US but there are dedicated desks. The line (a maze) moved pretty fast and so did security.

As proud Canadian citizens, we passed through the immigration quickly even though we had to declare some chocolate that we bought from Tokyo International airport. All our checked luggages came in the carousel within half a minute. I was completely amazed by the efficiency of Vancouver airport! We arrived on Canada day, so there were Canada pins put out for people to take, and the statues were excellent. We had a bit of a hard time finding the car rental place though, and the staff in the airport were helpful yet some were expressionless. When we arrived again in YVR from YYJ, our luggage was the only one so we got it as soon as we got there. And departing YVR was great as well. We checked in for the United Airlines flight to San Francisco, and since we took Business Class we had Priority check in, which saved a whole load of time as the Economy queue was huge. The US border security was fast and really smooth (we were on Business Class tickets and we cannot find the Business lane so we queued in the Economy lane), and the security personnel were extremely friendly opposed to the army like situation in SFO when exiting the US.

There were 15 people or so in front of me and - it took me over 30 minutes to go through security! The queues were moving so slowly because of the inefficient and poorly managed security screening area at YVR. While security screening is within the mandate of CATSA it is the YVR airport's responsibility to co-ordinate this process with CATSA so that travellers have a pleasant journey departing the airport. That was not my experience this time and has very rarely been my experiences at YVR. Apart from the security screening there was one food store (Tim Hortons) open that evening in YVR Domestic Terminal. A major airport like YVR can and should do much better.

Would you expect passengers arriving on internal Canadian flights to make their own way to the front of this queue and ""merge"" in with the existing queue?

I understand that there aren't many flights departing at night but still. Also they had problems with bridge retracting that caused a 90 minute delay in departure (Chine Airlines to TPE).

Even went through US Customs on the way and the waits were all reasonable. We made our connecting flight with time to spare. Our return trip was not so easy. In San Francisco we were given a brief explanation about getting our luggage near Canada Customs and having to transfer it ourselves. Once through Customs (the line was very short so there was no problem - but getting there from the plane was a long walk) on the way to picking up our luggage we asked one of the information people (right beside carousel 25) about getting our luggage to our connecting flight. She was totally useless!!! She told us we had to exit the terminal and go back in to the check-in area. That made no sense to us. My daughter had noticed the sign for connecting flights in Canada and that made more sense to me. Of course the helper overheard us and then asked for our boarding cards and then changed her mind and agreed with us!

Just a few minutes and I was off to pick up my baggage. However after getting the bags as a passenger with a connecting flight to another Canadian city I experienced the most bizarre line-up to clear customs. In all my years of landing in Vancouver and connecting to another Canadian city I have never experienced such a horribly long line. In the past we walked out and deposited our checked bags fairly quickly. After which I assume they were security screened in the same manner that any baggage is. So why are we suddenly required to line up and wait while each passenger's bag is slowly screened? The more bizarre twist is that those people who are exiting the airport are expeditiously moved through customs and sent out into the country. Why are connecting passengers treated so differently? If for example a passenger brought an illegal item in their baggage they are able to exit and be let loose in Canada but if connecting to another city all their bags are searched and must be scanned in their presence? Why must a connecting passenger be present for screening when someone who checks in upstairs can simply drop off their bags? Simply because of this bottleneck due to an extremely illogical and inefficient system I will be trying to avoid this otherwise fine airport in the future. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I need is a pointless 2 hour wait in line to have my baggage screened!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The covered parking lot is very expensive so you might want to consider the uncovered ones. Check-in is all done by the SAVE personnel (it's the managing company of the airport) not the airlines so they tend to be rather strict with the weight allowances. In many cases I have experienced long lines at check-in and I believe that the check-in area is rather small and can get congested very quickly. Security has improved a lot recently (they have re-designed the check points) and it has become a lot faster. The shopping area is well presented and with a fairly wide choice of boutiques considering the size of the airport. Perhaps it is lacking of chairs. The upper floor also features a smoking room which perhaps is not kept super tidy. The Marco Polo Lounge is OK but not the best of the lounges: access is the same as every other lounge (scanning of the boarding pass) the food offerings are not particularly thrilling (most of the time some cold pizzas some stale sandwiches and some broken up cookies) beverages selection is rather wide instead and it is self service; there is complimentary wifi in the lounge even though the signage indicates that you have to pay; the upkeep of the lounge is OK.

The problem with this airport is always the same: it is under dimensioned for peak periods traffic. As some check-ins have already been moved downstairs the whole departures up-arrivals down scheme should be rethought. Downstairs space look under-utilised while upper floor busts with passengers.

In consequence we lost the departure slot and were delayed for a further hour and a quarter all cooped up on the plane before the flight was re- routed and able to get away.

My father and I waited a tedious 30 minutes in the queue for a 5 minute flight to Vancouver.

Most of the things stated in previous comments are true. But at least one has changed radically after the latest terror threats. In contrast to YVR there is only one security control for all flights (domestic flights to Canada and international flights to Seattle and Salt Lake City). The first oddity was that a security officer awaited me in front of the controls just to find out whether I wanted to go to the USA or to remain in Canada. As I was merely going to return to YVR I was told that I could keep my shoes on whereas all passengers travelling to Seattle had to take them off to have them x-rayed. (What if I smuggled in something for someone I was to meet in the departure lounge who was heading for the USA?) The second oddity was that the security officers checked my hand luggage by hand after screening and found two sealed one-portion packages of marmalade which I had taken from my hotel's breakfast room earlier that morning.

It helps that on Austrian Airlines flights that the IFE system is used to inform transiting passengers of the gate number that their connecting flight is departing from. With that knowledge and the airport plan map in the in- flight magazine it's very easy to understand where you need to get to on arriving in the terminal before you even leave the aircraft. There is clear signage and displays to aid transiting passengers in the terminal. 1 security screen on arrival handled quickly by pleasant staff. Toilet facilities are plentiful and clean. Walkways are wide. There is plenty of seating at the departure gate. Free Wi-Fi in departures at VIE. The usual shops selling food and non-food items at ridiculous prices. Boarding gate staff were pleasant and professional. Baggage was transferred from incoming to outgoing flight without problem so well done to them.

Airport continues to be efficient and pleasant to use on departure but arrivals are a little hit-and-miss: airbridges are still rarely used and waiting times in buses can be a little on the lengthy side. Security and immigration were cleared quickly on all occasions. Baggage reclaim tends to be rather slow. Transiting can be awkward when arriving from abroad - the signs seem to indicate the direction which passengers should go but this leads you to security then the main part of the terminal and not to passport control - the correct way to transit is to follow the signs which say ""passport control"" and only then to clear security but the signage is confusing! This is not an issue when arriving from another Polish airport however. I have been caught out twice like this and it is not due to language issues. As transit security generally consists of only one X-ray machine pax arriving in a full or widebody aircraft need to ensure that they have plenty of time to make connections.

The difference is incredible at least on departure. The new terminal is light well-ventilated and feels a little like a smaller version of LHR T5. The orange décor used throughout risks making the terminal feel like it's run by Easyjet but one gets used to it. Passing through passport control couldn't be quicker helped by the fact that the terminal has been divided into Schengen and non-Schengen areas by glass screens (passport control for the non-Schengen flights is about halfway along the terminal). Security clearance was quick efficient and friendly. T1 and T2 are linked together both landside and airside but one has to check-in at the appropriate terminal. Several airlines including LOT and BA now have long-overdue self check-in machines. T1 now looks increasingly tired and neglected with reduced facilities airside but retaining all its previous facilities landside. T2 however has few facilities landside but excellent facilities airside all the way from just after security to the far end of the terminal. Clearly this airport is finally making significant steps towards providing a quality service for passengers with improvements in customer service and politeness throughout. However it's not quite there yet.

The TSA officials are very efficient and courteous and the Aerotrain is also very convenient as well. Coming back is another story even though Dulles has improved. First of all are the ancient plane mates which take you to the international arrivals building but which will be used for the foreseeable future.

It worked just fine when there were two flights to London and one to Paris every day. Then they built the ""mid-field terminals"". Now there are so many international flights that immigration and customs on arrival can take hours and here's a real kicker-there are two separate immigration and customs areas.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Meyer,United States,2013-03-12,"My least favorite airport in the country. Nowhere else that I know of does it typically take an hour between curbside dropoff and reaching your gate - thanks to long security lines a haphazardly designed satellite terminal layout and an insufferably slow combination of underground people movers and ""mobile lounges"" that do anything but whisk you to your departure gate. Late night arrivals are even worse as both the mobile lounges and people movers run on only 20-to-30 minute intervals making 45 minute trips from deplaning to baggage claim the general rule. Incredibly checked bags usually take even longer to reach the terminal. Terminal C which is the domain of the airport's dominant carrier United is little more than a glorified double- wide trailer with low ceilings and sometimes-working air conditioning.

These are a long way from the terminal. D concourse is only accessible by a slow mobile lounge that will be crammed full; the concourse is packed and has some of the worst food options in a major US airport. The other week the air conditioning could not cope with 37 C / 100 F temperatures. Arriving on a domestic flight it took us 45 minutes from landing to get to baggage claim. The A and B concourses are bright spacious and convenient.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Meyer,United States,2012-02-06,One of my least favourite airports. This airport has expanded haphazardly over the course of several decades and is poorly designed and laid out. Amazingly the new Aerotrain which shuttles you from the main terminal building to the satellite terminals is no faster than the painfully slow so-called mobile lounges that used to be the sole means of transport between terminals. I always have to allow 45 minutes or more to travel from the drop-off/check-in area to the gate. Several times when arriving on a late night flight I've had to wait 20 minutes or more for the next Aerotrain. Security lines are the longest I've seen primarily because half the security lanes are normally closed similar situation with customs - never enough personnel to man the available counters and as a result lines are commonly 45 minute or more. While Dulles suffers from some irreparable design flaws it would be much better if airport management would simply ensure that they make better use of the facilities they do have - by having more customs and security personnel on hand and by running the Aerotrain at reasonable intervals at all hours to speed transit through the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

washington-reagan-national-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-reagan-national-airport,Washington National Airport customer review,M Hartt,NA,2003-10-19,National is a beautiful airport with a great area for departures on the top level with views out towards Washington. You go down one level to the terminals but there are also a number of great stores before you go through security including things like Brooks Brothers. In each of the terminals there are some decent food options though pricey. However the airport is very clean and kept in good shape which is unusual and appreciated. Complaints: First to go between the different terminals requires going in and out of security a pain if you have a tight connection. Second National is very pricey for certain flights considering it's a little domestic airport. The airport has a heavy US Airways presence but because it brings in a lot of business and political traffic that can evidently afford it both US and other airlines jack up prices on non- competitive routes - the ones I've dealt with included DCA-BNA (Nashville) and DCA-SDF (Louisville). And it's not like the shuttles to Boston and NYC are dirt cheap either. Comparing costs between DCA and BWI says it all often 350$ out of National when only 190-225$ out of BWI (but you have to deal with going out of BWI). But it is incredibly convenient right on the Metro (one of the best subway systems in the country) and an easy cab ride to downtown and easy to get to from all of the Virginia and many Maryland suburbs.

Yet the automated pay machines do not accept 50Euro notes or Laser debit cards. Staff are very friendly and the small size of the building is makes a pleasant change from most other airports. At present catering is limited to drinks and snacks. Beware of one outrageous thing: each passenger is required to pay a fee of 5Euro at check-in to fund the future development of the airport. Nowhere during the booking process is this mentioned. Furthermore when other busineses plan expansions there is no requirement for current customers to pay upfront.

Thankfully our plane was an 15-seater and the non-functioning baggage carousel wasn't required. On the other hand departure for Dar es Salaam meant a long queue at the curbside check-in at the same time as two flights bound for Italy: utter chaos but amazingly planes did take off more or less on time.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
zaragoza-airport,/airport-reviews/zaragoza-airport,Zaragoza Airport customer review,A Martin,Belgium,2010-01-08,Pretty new terminal opened about a year and half ago. Its an improvement on the old terminal. Not many flights and 90% of them from Ryanair. Basic regional airport that does the job (not huge lines to check in or pass security). Dont go through security unless your flight its about to depart since in the air side there is only a little bar/cafeteria and two vending machines. not too many seat if there are two flights at the same time. In the land side good bar and resto. Bad Bus connection to the city and expensive taxi service (25 EUR to centre). So overall small nice airport that allows you to show up 1h before your flight departs without risk of missing the plane!!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

At best a very lacklustre boring experience. Poor appearance - very basic like they slapped it together from left-over concrete - reminded me of bad 70's architecture - grey walls punctuated by orange; terrible washrooms (men's for some reason are one floor up and you have to take the stairs) - they look dingy and appear unclean. Very few stores - duty free is overpriced with a limited selection staff are OK but they almost project a wary apologetic attitude - understandable considering what they have to work with. Rather abrupt and terse staff at passport/security checkpoint. One cafe with somewhat reasonable prices but still expensive coffee and pastries. Unfortunately this area (E gates) is all we got to see hope it is not representative of the rest of the airport.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,L Vied,United Kingdom,2014-02-27,Recently passed through this airport on a ski trip to Morzine in France. Being a Swiss airport we were expecting a high spec efficient clean and architecturally pleasing airport but we were so wrong. Granted we arrived into the charter section but even so the first impressions were not good. We disembarked our flight onto the concrete runway in the open air and were herded onto busses like cattle and driven to a dull and drab arrivals hall. However this was the least of our problems. We then stood in this dull and drab baggage hall for 45 mins waiting for our luggage. Departure was no better. Our check in was again in what appeared to be the charter section but then we went into a room with seats and had to wait for a bus to take us to the international departure area. Upon arrival we were somewhat hopeful that things were looking up as it appeared to be a bright modern looking space with duty free shopping outlets. However things started to look bad again when we used the toilets which were disgusting. There were cleaning staff on the concourse with trolleys laden with cleaning aids but we are not sure what they were doing. The one food outlet on our concourse was very badly designed in as much as if you are sitting in there eating or drinking you cannot access any flight information as there is no board within visual. You have to walk out into the centre of the concourse to see a board. Some departure gates are a 15 min walk away! Ours was a full to capacity charter flight and the way the ground staff handled the boarding process was a shambles. It was a free for all. They should have boarded us by seat numbers and relevant sections. For a country that prides itself on being efficient and clean this airport is a disgrace in every respect.

The drive from central Delhi to the airport took about 30 minutes but the roads were relatively jam free for Delhi on a mid Monday morning.

Departing from T3 a couple of days later to London was a struggle. Check-in was fast but the queue for immigration took 30 minutes and that for security took nearly an hour – the problem being not enough staff on duty for all of the scanners (and this was at a peak departure time).

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Pease,France,2014-11-20,Having seen the construction of the 'new' single terminal Stansted Airport and having used it extensively over the last 25 years my latest experience (inbound 7 November outbound 11 November) showed positive changes in the speed of flow through Border Control and outgoing security (which although I could have been 'lucky' in my arrival and departure times cannot be anything but a good thing) but I was horrified by the World DutyFree shopping area which dominates the start of the airside facilities. No daylight lowered ceilings and nowhere to go but to wind my way through hell and heavy sales pitches all too similar to what I hate about Manchester airport. The redevelopment airside is all to do with commercial opportunity and this coupled with the lack of seating and natural daylight really drags this airport down. It's almost a pleasure to reach the relatively spartan wing of the terminal given over to Ryanair's flights and even then today I found myself for the first time going down what used to be the domestic arm of the terminal building which was even less appealing on the eye but far more suited to air travel rather than high-end shopping. It is disappointing to see so few if any domestic flights and the whole airport seems to be losing its function putting commercial activities ahead of a short walk from the street to the gate which was one of the USPs of the initial design. I would recommend the airport for its proximity to London the wide range of destinations it serves and for good ground transport links but regret that I no longer feel that I could recommend it as an airport because it seems to be principally an upmarket shopping experience with a flight thrown in.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Nick Paul,NA,2008-06-12,Tip for passport control - if you go to gate H the passport desks there are less used than those closer to the gates A etc. so if you are in a hurry walk a further 100m on and you should be through passport control very quickly. As security control is at the gates not straight after passport control do not leave shopping until the last minute or you will get caught up in a queue for boarding which might cause some delays.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

east-midlands-airport,/airport-reviews/east-midlands-airport,East Midlands Airport customer review,Nick Kirk,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,Maybe all the people posting reviews about security staff at EMA should just stop think and take stock of why staff might get a little disgruntled and why queues can be so long. If passengers arrived consistently early as advised followed the instructions about liquids emptied their pockets properly and basically followed the rules (all of which are well publicised) then the process would be much simpler and easier for all. And next time you are waiting in the queue just think its all for your safety. Outbound security is there to identify possible threats to the airport and your flight. Would you rather they skipped through things. If they are taking time to scrutinise an x-ray then its because there is something they are not sure about. I have travelled through EMA and other airports and EMA are very good and friendly. No problems if you treat the staff with the same respect you would expect from them.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The usual interrogation at immigration then the inexplicable procedure of collecting your baggage only to have it taken away again with no explanation of how to collect it. Then another 45 minutes standing in line to go through security just to leave the airport.

jersey-airport,/airport-reviews/jersey-airport,Jersey Airport customer review,Christian Hodson,NA,2004-11-23,I used this airport in July for a short holiday and have to say I was surprised by how modern the facility is having always had the impression that the Channel Island airports would be very small and not have a lot to offer. The main terminal building is relatively new and is small without being too small. Check in is very efficient as is baggage reclaim staff are very friendly and since there are not many flights operating from the island the departure lounge is never busy. The only downside is that you cannot access the departure gates until your flight is available for boarding which can mean a very rushed visit to duty free ! The gate areas are not big enough to cope with a 150 seat B737 and are a little bit run down but as you are not spending a great deal of time there it's not a major issue. It is worth flying in by jet aircraft if you get a chance ( for example BMI Baby services from mainland UK airports such as Manchester / East Midlans ) as the scenic approach followed by the short runway make for a rather entertaining landing !,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Passing through a few days ago the queue for departures security checking had over 100 passengers waiting and stretched outside the terminal to the ""arrivals"" taxi queue! ""Upgrading"" the security area is currently causing regular 40/50 minute delays-after check-in. Airside insufficient seating had passengers standing and blocking walk ways whilst awaiting their flight departures-and this was mid-afternoon in November as opposed to a peak high season departure time. The arrival of Ryanair and the proposed January arrival of Easyjet (from BFS-Belfast International) has added to the considerable strain this facility was under over 3 years ago yet there are no signs of the expansion of passenger facilities. The ""passenger collection point"" was once a tin cabin in a far off point in the car park has dissapeared and has been replaced with an open plastic covered ""wind tunnel"". Add to this the proposed extension of the single runway to accept bigger longer range aircraft and total chaos will surely ensue unless passenger areas are at least DOUBLED in size and facilities. Perhaps the smooth spin-talking management should have to catch a flight from their own airport as ""ordinary passengers"" to experience just what their ""customers"" have to suffer. If this airport was a retail outlet it would have closed down years ago through its atrocious customer services and lack of management concern for those who pay their wages.

The passenger terminal has a run-down appearance to it that is in need of updating. Carpeting and wall paneling do not seem to have been upgraded in a while. The terminal lacks jet bridges and the baggage claim conveyor is out of doors which I actually find quite pleasant when the weather is nice but awful during rainstorms. The food and shopping options were minimal though I did not get a chance to check their prices. On the positive side however: the airport is very conveniently located for much of Los Angeles and has convenient access to the freeways. Despite the dilapidated look of the terminal it is a lot less confusing and intimidating than LAX - finding my way through the place was easy. The view of the mountains and desert outside of my airplane window on approach to the airport was enjoyable.

I asked a separate agent who was directing passengers for 'Express Service' and bargained him down to USD 45 for the three of us.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,Barry McKay,NA,2008-04-14,"Buenos Aires airport can be somewhat frustrating but compared to transiting through Washington Dulles en route to Canada it is a breeze. Upon arrival it takes some time in the queue to clear Immigration. You will be given a copy of your Immigration declaration put this away somewhere safe as you may be asked for it on departure. However the real problem  unless you can carry your baggage manually is the shortage of luggage carts. They are provided free of charge but there just aren't enough of them. I had to wait 30 minutes before airport staff finally arrived with some but friends who arrived later never did get one and had to man-handle their luggage to Customs. If you do have to wait for a cart you can use the opportunity to exchange US dollars at the bank that is adjacent to the Customs exit area - it's the one that airline staff use and they give a fair exchange rate. Clearance through Customs posed no problems once I got a cart but if you are taking a taxi downtown be extremely cautious. Do not under any circumstances accept the offer of taxi touts outside the airport offering to get you a cab - you can get badly burnt. Use only those yellow cabs parked at the official rank which you will see on exiting the airport. When leaving the best bet is to book a ""remise"" - a car that will pick you up and charge a pre agreed amount. In my case it cost 70 pesos from downtown to the airport. Airport departure procedures are more complex and frustrating than arrival. First you need to queue to obtain a boarding pass and the time this takes seems to vary from day to day. I went through in about 15 minutes but my friends took far longer than that. Next if you are going to claim a tax refund on purchases you will need to queue at the Customs booth - same ground floor level as the airline desks - to get your tax forms (the ones provided by the stores where you made your purchases) stamped. Next go upstairs to the tax refund office and queue once more to obtain your refund. This should not take more than 10 minutes. You will have the option of immediate payment in Argentine pesos or dollars which can be credited to a credit card. I took the cash as I will be returning to BA again. Next you have to queue once more to pay your airport departure tax - adjacent to the tax refund office. This can be paid in US dollars ($18.00) the equivalent in pesos or by credit card. When this is done you will go through initial screening next to the airport tax counter. Once inside you will next have to queue to pass Immigration. There is a form that has to be filled out - available at airline check-in desk - and you may possibly also be asked for the Immigration form you were give when arriving. Once this is done you are basically done until boarding time whan your hand luggage will be manually examined prior to boarding. To be sure of getting through all these procedures on time one should allow 2 1/2 hours to be on the safe side.

The original part was built in the late 1960's when I was born. Over the years I have watched it become bigger and try to keep up with the passenger flow and their needs. I can remember watching the old Northeast Airline ""Yellowbird"" 727s taxi up to the building and the passengers deplaning down the airstairs into 1 of 3 available gates. Now your view is blocked by the covered concourses if you can even make it into the secure gate area to have a chance to look out the windows.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,A Milossavlyevich,Serbia,2015-04-10,The overall impression - a polished mess. Ataturk is far too small for the number of passengers it handles and the lack of discipline doesn't help either what's noticeable even at low-peak times. The day of our flight a general black-out happened in Turkey meaning the trams and the trains weren't working for a certain amount of time. Allow at least two hours to arrive to the airport and one more to go through the customs and security control. Turkish Airlines check-in staff are not English speaking. Enough food options although overpriced and with a service leaving a lot to be desired. No A/C sockets in the entire terminal but there are machines where you can insert coins in order to charge your mobile - derisory if to remain polite. Toilets clean although the terminal is not especially the more remote gates such as 50X. Travel only if you have no other option than via Istanbul not a pleasant experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

After a long wait in a windowless hot environment finally got through however not a pleasant experience at all. Manchester is my local airport and I fly from here several times a month. In recent months Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 security has become a nightmare and I am beginning to dread this every time I fly. Unfortunately however Liverpool does not offer a lot of routes so I am very muck stuck with using Manchester.

Small and cramped departure areas where people are herded one hour before the boarding and are forced to sit on the floor due to lack of seating? Dingy and smelly toilets. Long bus rides around the runway where often the driver is himself unsure at which aircraft he has to stop. Surly and brusque customer service?

The only difference was that our flights last year coincided with several others whereas this time ours was the only arrival/departure for a couple of hours. The consequence was that Treviso this year was much more congenial than last year - no congestion no queues for anything plenty of seating. We don't normally buy food and drink at airports but on our return journey we were obliged to do so and were pleasantly surprised at both the cost and the quality: we had poorer and dearer food while we were in Venice. The ground crew also seem to do their best to apply Ryanair's stated boarding procedures which is more than seems to happen at Liverpool.

While the airport seems to always be under construction and isnt always the easiest for those transferring from one plane to another (especially if you come in on an international flight Terminal A and have to get to a regional connection in F) it is very easy to get in and out fo if you know some tricks. Always park in C or D garage and dont even try any floor below 4. Then use the new TSA checkpoint. DOnt even think about going in the through the checkpoint in B or you will be in line for a while. Philly finally is letting Southwest Business Select in the first class line in that main new TSA checkpoint so if you have fly-by or first class there you go 10 people in line at the most. As for being a busy airport; I dont know where some of these other people fly to that call philly busy. Have you been to Atlanta or Minneapolis? Philly is probably ~40% on the crowded scale. I mean go to terminal E and look at how many NW and SW gates are empty most of the day. Its no Manchester NH but on the other hand its no where near as crowded as Atlanta. Now for what sucks with PHL - if there is a drop of rain dont even think about landing in PHL on time. Overall I think PHL isnt too bad an airport especially if you live in the area as if is located pretty central to everything and easily gotten to off 95.

On the other hand I never use Ryan Air or Easy Jet (my last flight from STN was on Turkish) so maybe this helps.

Food is readily available at numerous snack bars plus an excellent Terrace restaurant accessible by lift beside the main bar. Shopping is plentiful and easy to find as you walk around the inner circle. Terminal 2 is the worst airport I have visited. It is separated into around six 'sub-terminals' which again are probably deserving of separate reviews. Terminal 2E is the only one I have visited and it is confusing poorly laid out and lacking in basic facilities. The shops are scattered in a random pattern making finding any one location a matter of trial and error - you can't even walk round them all efficiently. Worse for the gastronomic capital of the world the food is dire - a 'multi-cultural' food court serving microwaved curry pasta or lasagne is the only alternative to a stale sandwich or wilted salad. Further the staff just don't care. The terminal is over-staffed - 3 separate people to make sure you're in the right queue at security - yet on multiple occasions I have been 'suspended' for 5-10 minutes when the security staff decided to go on a break while my hand luggage was half way through the scanner and I had to wait until the next staff member arrived to continue my screening.

Aside from the actual facilities (not) on offer it is the people who work here that make this airport perhaps the worst that I have experienced. The biggest offenders are probably the Security people at the various checkpoints inside and at the entrance to the airport. They seem to make up the rules based on their fancy at that moment. Inconsistent security screening I expect leads to higher security risk (not surprised that the European airlines no longer fly here).

Despite the fact that we arrived at the 2 hr-before-flight- time recommended the queues at check-in desks were building fast. There were quite a few people who obviously had overweight bags and were being asked to adjust them. This seemed only to be happening at the Ryanair desks. Other adjacent C/I desks were moving at the normal rate. The flight was delayed by half an hour due to arguments and under-manning at the C/I stage. Although this is probably a regular feature when flying with Ryanair it should be discouraged by the airport authority as it leads to passenger stress potential rudeness to C/I staff and loss of revenue in the departure lounge and shops because passengers are denied any time to have a pre-flight break.

Currency exchange desk unmanned for several minutes on arrival resulting in long queue for local currency to purchase visa on arrival. One desk for such visas yet no-one on duty. It turned out we could not see the officer was asleep! Baggage for business class took 45 minutes to appear. Business class departure was initially more pleasant until getting near the gate where the chaos at a second security check and the gate itself was quite appalling. Transit on the way back from LHR to BKK was almost a farce when an Immigration officer accused me of trying to exit Jordan without having a visa despite my showing him by LHR/AMM boarding pass and ticket! It was only when a colleague put him right that he waived me on. Gate management was even worse: just one official taking a good 20 seconds to check each passenger against the manifest of a nearly full A330 and then no priority boarding - just a mad scrum.

Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the delay in baggage delivery on arrival into T5 from Manchester transfer between terminals 5 & 4 and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare - taking almost 3 hours lost in total. The lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (Sri Lankan shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – very spacious and relaxing environment plus excellent attentive service with good quality regularly refreshed buffet food (European and Asian). For an indirect flight we will continue to use Heathrow but only provided this is limited to T5 and we can through check.

johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,/airport-reviews/johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,Johannesburg Airport customer review,Colin Birch,United Kingdom,2011-10-22,Despite being a modern airport that has been upgraded recently due to last year’s Soccer World Cup there are many things that need serious improvement. The attitude of the staff leaves a lot to be desired especially at passport control. Who likes having their passport limply thrown back at them after being mumbled at? As a regular traveller to South Africa I’m used to it but for many people this is their first impression. There is a facility for international arrivals passengers with onward domestic connections whereby you can check in your luggage and receive your boarding card for your next flight prior to leaving international arrivals. It’s a good idea and reduces the chances of you being hassled by the porters when you enter the public area. However it’s not too clearly signed or easy to spot and only appears to be available for passengers travelling onwards with SAA or Express and Airlink. On our recent trip there was only one check in clerk with a small queue of around 7 people yet it took about 10 minutes to check the luggage and issue a boarding card. In our case the check in clerk didn’t even look at or speak to us. I managed to get her to speak by saying at the end “Is that it?” to which I received a whispered “yes”. However the same staff at South Africa’s provincial airports are completely different and are a pleasure to deal with. The two terminals are listed as A and B. With A being international and B domestic yet there is no indication of this. Domestic check-in is fine but international is dire. Too cramped dark a low roof and the attendants at the start of check in insist you check in at a self-service kiosk which doesn’t issue a boarding card but a slip acknowledging you are there. Then you still have to go through the normal check in routine. Each time I’ve travelled through this airport my bags have been tampered with. This is a problem that is widely known yet nothing seems to have been done about it. On one trip back to the UK starting at PLZ via JNB the check in clerk at PLZ suggested that I just checked my bags to JNB picked them up and rechecked them so that they had the least time unattended. I do this every time now. On the positive side facilities are fine with plenty of varied shops and places to eat both land and airside. A good thing to note is that domestic departures landside have much better shops and eating places than airside so if you have a long wait for your flight I recommend checking in and then get something to eat etc. before going through security. I would avoid this airport if I could but it’s not always possible.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It's now much easier to get to/from the airport using public transportation. As this airport has lower fees fares are usually cheaper compared to other large airport in the vicinity.

tel-aviv-airport,/airport-reviews/tel-aviv-airport,Tel Aviv Airport customer review,M Bedioui,NA,2008-12-31,Sometimes during security checks in TLV your bags and suitcases can be taken away from you for some minutes as they scan them in other rooms. My advice is to check that everything is still in your bag when it comes back because they empty the bags away from you before scanning them and put things back by themselves. The lost and found office has only one part-time English speaking worker and is rings busy most of the time. They really completely emptied all my bags scanned every piece and I was body-searched too. This was about 50 minutes long. The staff was nice smily and efficient.

The terminal itself was beautiful and very western except for broken toilets in the bathrooms. The next morning the 5am Egyptair to Aswan. The terminal requires security to reach check in then once again at the gate. I don't think they even looked at the first screening. The airport was clean and very modern. Boarding through the gate was strange as a man opened the door and simply said ""time to board"" not through a PA system or anything. Departing on Air france a week later through terminal 1 was crazy. People can pay security a few dollars to jump ahead cutting our group of kids into chunks. Check in was painfully slow but that is the airline's fault. Customs heading out was fast and the man gave me a strange look for not having an arrivals stamp. At the gate one metal detector was there to screen our airbus 330! Again 5 pounds and passengers were escorted to the front of the line.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Christopher Moore,United Kingdom,2011-08-07,The decision to book with Wizz Air from Luton for bigger baggage allowance was not a good one. Arriving about 5.45am on a Sunday morning 2.5 hrs ahead of the flight dumped us in a 1 mile+ 40 min traffic queue on the approach road. Who designed the several-dual-carriageways funnelling down to one lane culminating with incoming traffic being blocked by in and out junctions to/from drop off and short term car parks? It is the most inept piece of road design I have ever encountered. How on earth did it ever get planning approval? And then to have to pay £7.50 for about an hour of short term car park to get my family's baggage dropped off was a shocker. Two thirds of the check-in desks were unused and the rest were rammed with frustrated travellers delayed by a faulty baggage conveyor. Having finally dropped off the baggage and seen people to the stairs to Security (escalators not working) I went to the loo before the drive home. Even the design of that was incompetent with narrow corridors in and out leaving people queuing although there were plenty of free facilities once inside. I have never been to a more ineptly designed airport anywhere or one which cynically rips off its customers as badly. Poor signposting coming in means it's easy to get ripped off for a £1 drop-off fee if you take the wrong turn (easily done) instead of the overpriced car park.

Apparently there was too much luggage below so they stopped all the conveyor belts at check in. This happened twice for about 20 minutes on each occasion.

The Schengen terminal upon arrival was uncrowded so that everything went smoothly. But it is a long walk through endless corridors to reach the baggage claim area. Transfer into Milan city centre is operated by two competing bus companies with rather the same prices. Allow at least 55min between Malpensa and the city easily more in rush-hour periods. Upon departure there are very few and small flight information screens making it difficult to locate the right check-in desks. It is even more difficult to find the gates as security checks take place at an intermediate floor between Arrivals and Departures floors! Security employees were efficient and friendly. The Schengen file (for Gates A) was quick enough but the Non-Schengen queue (for Gates B) seemed to be chronically congested.

When I connected through Paris I had to leave the secure area with the complete family just to start the security mess all over again. The passenger walk areas are packed with lines so it is very hard to get from one side to another. We got separated multiple times. To get from one flight to another requires a lot of walking and mind reading. I do not know what the airport planners had on their mind when they planned this mess. Signs are a joke. You have to know what gate belongs to what terminal. Before the customs some firm is checking that your carry- on is not overweight. If so they send you back to the lines to check in the personal items you do not want to check-in. It does not matter if you are just connecting. The staff that tries to help are untrained and can't even read boarding passes. Air conditioning seems to be not existent. Food in the new Terminal is awful. They offer microwave food to self microwave it. Is that French cuisine? Microwaves are without English instruction sets. We watched several people messing up their food because they only have instructions on the box and appliances. Besides the usual laptop the security wanted every cable iPod iPad usb stick phone camera lenses plugs outside in the plastic bin.

Auckland is a good airport and is a breeze to use polite helpful staff and a large departure hall plentiful food outlets and you don't have to walk miles to get to your gate. You also don't get ambushed by staff trying to sell you things as you do at many American airports as you walk through duty free to reach your gate.

The exit to the Ryanair 'wing' has been moved and the passageway along the windows has been narrowed and access to the toilets removed. This makes for considerable congestion - including a few brave souls returning to the terminal against the flow, and the narrowing seems to be also in force in the 'underground' corridor between the departures lounge and the steps/escalator to the Ryanair 'wing', which made some of the older people around me panic that they might miss their flight. The airport was extremely busy and the only new, but major, criticism I have was the queue at the Ryanair desk at the start of the Ryanair 'wing' which stretched back into the corridor and the escalator/steps area due to handling passengers whose flight had been cancelled. This made it very congested for passengers arriving at the 'wing' for their gates. It might be helpful if the queue for passengers needing attention from the desk be separated by ropes so that the flow of passengers into the terminal could be better controlled as there is a potential danger of 'overcrowding' in such a small, enclosed area.",Arrival and Departure,06-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,3,3,3,NA,3,3,NA,NA,0

Its a small airport and yes the facilities are not great but at least we have an airport locally which can provide the basics. As far as I'm concerned a lot of people who have commented or are going to want everything for nothing. From my understanding the development fee is to help keep the airport running and keeping the flights going - which you are having to or had to use! Norwich Airport is not comparable to Gatwick or Stansted because it is much smaller and non government funded. If people were grateful for the fact they don't have to travel for hours before even reaching the airport then we wouldn't have a problem with the fee!

This time in in the morning from Basel and out late evening for Edinburgh. On arrival I was delighted to see far more staff manning the border control checkpoints and more e-gates open. A really quick passage through, only stymied by waiting for our baggage for more than 20 mins. Some you win, some you lose. On my return, I was taking my first 'domestic' flight to Edinburgh. Once upon a time, domestic flights had a different part of the airport, and no security, but those days are gone. I was processed quickly and efficiently by security although the area was very busy. Having a lot of time before my flight I decided to investigate the shops, but wasn't tempted. There is a considerable choice of dining options and with a long wait ahead I enjoyed my meal at Giraffe. Once my gate was called, I had a new experience but not one that I'd care to repeat often. My flight was called to Gate 84, via a tunnel with streams of passengers walking in both directions with no separation of inbound and outbound passengers. Once in the gate area, there were no separations of the four flights due to depart - two to Edinburgh, one to Glasgow and one to Belfast. It was quite disconcerting to see people openly drinking from beer bottles and as there were no separation markers, it was very hard to find out where to queue (especially the difference between 'speedy' boarding and 'other' boarding in the case of my Easyjet flight). Passengers inbound from these aircraft simply walked up to the area where we were waiting and had to push their way through the throng of waiting passengers to get into the tunnel and back to the terminal. Is it always like this on a Friday night at this time?

Returning a Hire car is a joke as the traffic around the airport is horrific and the car hire is off site so you have to pile onto a bus which adds even more time. The queues at check in are biblical especially with EasyJet speedy boarding is more than value for money particularly on a Ski transfer day. Having done both I think it is now easier (and cheaper) to Hire from the French side and if you have to go on Swiss motorways pre-order the toll pass. On a ski transfer day leave yourself lots of extra time then add an hour to that and you should avoid undue stress. Finally as others have said security is an absolute bun fight.

She then decided to pick on my sister by shouting that the plastic bag with the toiletries in was not acceptable she replied that it was OK at Gatwick so why not here? There was no response to this other than a tiny plastic bag being thrown at her with the result of her having to put some items in my toiletries bag or throw them away. We both went through the screening arch and I got stopped screened and searched but at least the young lady there was sympathetic when I asked her to be careful as I'd had a hip operation and was still in recovery.

We took 5 flights to and from T5 during our holiday. This last one was our 6th flight. We were all very tired when we got to the airport. We arrived with 3 hours to spare. We tried using the self service check in kiosk even though it never worked on our previous flights. Of course this time it didn't work again. So off we went to counter B1 for assistance. There were only 3 groups before us in that queue so we thought it won't take us long. How wrong we were. One group took 5-10 mins which was ok but the second one took over 50 mins. To make matters worse after this group finally left the staff at the counter attended to a big group which wasn't even in the queue. Of course we were not happy and moved away. My husband decided to ask the staff at self service check in kiosk to help us check in. She was attending to my husband when my kids and I joined him. She had obviously checked in some of us and then asked for the passport of the fourth person without telling me who she has already checked in because I wasn't there. I gave her the wrong passport and that's when she started talking to me condescendingly. She threatened not to proceed with checking me in. By that time my kids and husband had already been checked in I had a lot more to say to her but had to hold my tongue as all I wanted was to be checked in and get on my flight. Were finally checked in after 1.5 hrs. Just as well we arrived early. I am so shocked with how bad the service is and how the staff can get away with it. Of course our BA flight to Singapore was delayed like all other flights that we took during our holiday. This time it was delayed for 3 hours. 2 hours of that we were stuck in the plane.

Also the Hilton chain is building a hotel just across the street of the international arrivals. The international cargo area was massively expanded and they are also going to build another runaway. I think that such a modern city as Caracas really needed its airport to be renovated  besides Caracas Intl works as a hub for many European and Latin American airlines so the passengers traffic is being increasing during the last 5 years.

The selection of shops in particular seemed pretty abysmal (not a patch on LHR T5). Thank goodness for the BA lounge which was pleasant and comfortable. I would not have liked to have spent 6 hours in the terminal itself.

We passed through yesterday returning from holiday and were treated with disrespect and indifference. Due to flight cancellations we were forced to spend over 7 hours here. Firstly upon arrival we were very rudely told to sit outside in what could best be described as cattle pens exposed to constant traffic noise and fumes, and cigarette smoke from airport staff. Absolutely no information whatsoever was given as to why we were put there or for how long. I eventually ventured into Terminal 5 and approached BA desk and staff told me to go back to the waiting area, I was told I could not re enter the terminal until 1215 - 3 hours later.  Eventually we were allowed into the terminal and were shrugged through to a queue to check in - we duly queued after checking we were in the right queue at right time and this confirmed, we got to the counter and were told we could not check in because they were still checking the flight before ours. We were furious by now as one might understand however went to back of long queue. I then approached a BA staff member and he sorted things out quickly and we got checked through within 5 minutes.

After parking the car in the short term parking area I was in the terminal building within a few minutes. Once through to the departure lounge though I found the area very small indeed. Not a great choice of eating/snack areas. But generally Ok for a regional airport.

The airport is located at an end of the city so for most folks (Galveston/Sugarland/Pearland) it takes at least 45 mins without traffic to reach the airport. The airport compared to others has no facilities for kids that I am aware of thus you find yourself under stress and occupied instead of calm and relaxed if you have kids. The dining is exceptional but the layout of the airport is terrible. It is impossible to get from one terminal to the other without counting a 10 min walk (not that I don't like walking but when it comes to getting to your plane) where as in airports like Denver and Hongkong Travel is a lot easier for those that have a connection. The staff at the airport isn't nice/respectful and the airport does not provide language assistance for those that do speak English or Spanish. Immigration lines are incredibly long but at least the airport has Air Conditioning (Unlike Bombay). The other thing the airport lacks is the style/feel.

Traffic to the airport is a nightmare. Narrow and always blocked by never ending roadworks. Trains to the airport are dirty and at least 40 year old wrecks and you pay an horrendous price. Ticket area for trains is small dirty and always full with people queuing for the one single open sales point. (Machines do not accept foreign cards or credit cards.) Luggage delivery takes an average of 1.5 hours (yes 1.5 hours) almost a world record. Waiting time for the passport control can be up to 2 hours. The non-Schengen shopping area is almost non-existent. -Cleanliness and overall the state of maintenance is very poor. My advise go to Paris CDG. From there 1h 12m TGV to Brussels.

However on my latest trip this weekend I flew on Air France and had to endure the absolute fiasco that is Terminal 2. The layout of Terminal 2 is simply woeful. This is compounded further by the general inefficiency associated with any process that you need to follow within France. On arrival the combination of a shuttle ride long walks along endless corridors long queues at passport control slow baggage processing and insane queues at the Terminal 2 RER station's ticketing machines meant it took me over 2 hours from landing to being sat on the RER to Paris. Unfortunately the return leg was no better. Signage was a total farce the electronic check in is pointless as the service is duplicated by the baggage drop off desk (which had a major queue backlog) passport control and security are hopelessly slow and when you finally get through to the departure lounge gate area - there are nothing but handbag shops. The area serving the 'K' gates needs a proper food court with a decent selection of outlets with quick turn around times - the small restaurant area on the 1st floor is just pathetic. Having lived in France for a good few years I always leave plenty of extra time because things tend to happen slowly. However CDG is just beyond a joke.

Then the plane was delayed because the bags for the people who missed the flight had to be removed! They are simply not geared up to handle the number of people they have to process and need to urgently consider cutting the number of flights leaving the airport from this terminal. The security gates just can not process people quick enough. For Arrivals the design of the terminal is appalling.

Despite our luggage being on the carousel when we arrived at baggage claim the scene was one of utter chaos. A never ending queue of tired travelers with no discernible beginning point. There were no staff directed travelers to the right areas/queue. When we finally found a staff member he said he didn't know where the queue started and suggested we follow a lady who was also looking. International travelers were left to an unmanaged rabble. Lots of arguments between travelers for pushing in etc. We eventually 'found' a queue end and proceeded to pin step around the baggage carousels for 1 and a quarter hours with a by now very unhappy tired little one.

Check in at easyJet  was brilliant but only because I had upgraded my seat and had speedy boarding. The queue for none speedy boarders was huge the famous Gatwick snake. At security I was stopped as usual because I have a replacement hip, I told the security guy of this as he asked me if I had anything sharp on me as he needed to search me. He replied I know you have I can tell. I asked him why he needed to search me if he knew what had set the scanner of. He then called his supervisor, I explained what had happened and he glared at the security guy and said sorry its procedure. Interestingly coming back from Corfu I didn't even set their security equipment off. Why do I need to show my boarding card to buy a newspaper at Smiths? On return journey for some reason the aircraft parked away from the terminal and we were bussed back. But we were dropped of miles from passport control, where I encountered a massive Gatwick snake at least 15 rows long. All the passport desks were open and manned. The guy at passport control was pleasant, obviously hadn't had the scowl and be miserable chip inserted yet. I then waited at least 15 to 20 minutes to be informed which carousel the luggage was on?

Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long.

This means that there is an excellent selection of dining and shopping facilities. The major downside of using terminal 3 is that whilst these renovations are being undertaken there is no air-conditioning so is extremely hot especially at busy times. All airports in the Philippines have a security check as you enter the airport where you are required to show the guard a copy of your ticket in order to gain entry into the airport. This can be a problem if the airline sends you the e-ticket in the form of a corrupted pdf which cannot be opened! Had to call the airline and get them to send a representative to confirm I had a ticket in order to obtain entry into the airport. There are currently roadworks on the roads around the airport (Skyway extension) which can significantly add to the already congested roads and journey times.

In the main area there are TVs newspapers and magazines but only of local interest. A small food area is nicely set out selection of food a little disappointing although its plentiful you can help yourself to tea coffee and soft drinks as often as you want. The cost in $40.00 but if you are only in Doha for a short time its not worth paying .

The airport authority are clearly investing in and upgrading the buildings with the income from increased flights and staff are always courteous and efficient and board the flights by sequence number. The airport is a bit far out like all Ryanair destinations but just try getting to CDG at peak times and you will soon appreciate the drive through the French countryside from Beauvais. For car rentals returns I suggest going into Beauvais centre to fill up your tank as all the petrol stations around the airport close by 7:00pm and the machines only seem to accept French Visa cards. Instead of turning right at the airport road traffic lights turn left past McDonalds and follow the signs for Beauvais centre / Cathedral - which is a straight road. Just at the town centre traffic lights turn right and you will see a Total petrol station open until 10:00pm.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
philadelphia-airport,/airport-reviews/philadelphia-airport,Philadelphia Airport customer review,J Sabaduquia,United States,2013-04-24,Had a very tight connection after our flight from PUJ was delayed by nearly an hour. Immigration and customs was absolutely painless and the agent that accommodated us was a pleasure to deal with and tried his best to get us out there as soon as possible similar to Atlanta fastest I've dealt with immigration. Our bag was tagged as priority by US Airways (with my status with United) and was the very first one to come out from the carousel. We had to bring our luggage to a transfer carousel which was easy enough. Security was a bit rude but got out of there quick enough and didn't care much. Transferred to the F concourse through a bus which was quick and easy. E concourse was very small cramped but for regional flights it was definitely sufficient and had good food options and ample seating.

jeddah-airport,/airport-reviews/jeddah-airport,Jeddah Airport customer review,Syed Sarfraz,NA,2007-04-30,For an oil-rich country Jeddah airport certainly doesn't feel like it's in one. First after paying the porter 10 riyals he walked us up to the check-in counter line and bailed on us explaining that one of these desks will take your luggage. In Abu Dhabi this would not happen as the porter would extend further courtesy to get you ahead. So then you have no clue which desk exactly you have to check-in at as the screens above the counters don't function. There's no proper queue. An airport security guy comes by and asks where we are going and directs us to cut into a line at a different counter. Couldn't get a word in to ask him any other questions as he disappeared pointing to people to jump into different queues. Finally we find out the check-in attendant where we stood at the previous queue was indeed taking in passengers from our flights. We were fortunate to jump back in. The weight machines are like a blast from the past. Afterwards at another point 15 minutes standing in line to get past a security officer for the immigration counter inside we finally reach the front only to be told we need to fill out immigration cards. Great. We do and return to him only to find he's not there and they're letting everyone to the immigration counter (though they still had to fill out the cards at the counter)! We finally reach the boarding lounge. We decide to buy some food from the cafe'. We wanted only a simple meal but the employees kept adding fruit salads cake deserts and croissants onto our trays even though we asked them not to they replied back saying it was standard. We had to pay 108 riyals for what we thought would have been some simple meal with complimentary snacks. Can't help but feel we got purposely ripped. No screen monitor in the main lounge gives the gate number for any of the flights. After an uncourteous official we find a guy who simply tells us to wait for an announcement for the gate number. There was a private lounge and we had a Priority Pass card. It was rejected by a meek smile and a flimsy excuse 'this is a special club sir'. Later I found out the Priority Pass card was suppose to be accepted there. They might have a fancy cafe' and chairs and a quite room and relative cleanliness (repeat: relative to airports in poor countries that is) but they don't hide the efficency of the airport (especially for an airport that is the main point for Hajj and an international airport for one of the richest countries in the world).

But there are two areas desperately needing improvement. With this in my opinion OAK would be ideal. First baggage claim. OAK has the slowest baggage claim I've seen. Without fail I am waiting for no less than half an hour after getting to baggage claim and it's been much longer at times. I can only speculate as to the reason whether it is the baggage transfer staffing or the facility design but it is always the most frustrating task at the end of a long trip. Second is the drop-off/pick-up area. It was ideal with there was a small parking lot for those waiting to pick up passengers. It hugely reduced the traffic congestion and otherwise was such a relief to those who had to go around and around and around while waiting for their passengers (who were probably waiting 45 minutes for baggage). The baggage claim is definitely the higher priority of these two.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport looked rather grim and rundown and in need of either a fresh coat of paint or renovation to catch up with the time. There are no land-bridges so folks disembark and embark via tarmac. I made used of the domestic terminal so there was no custom clearance required upon reaching destination.

cork-airport,/airport-reviews/cork-airport,Cork Airport customer review,Nico Nieuwstraten,NA,2005-10-08,With the new automated Boarding Pass terminals the check-in is pretty speedy which makes the check-in efficient. Restaurant & bar upstairs are reasonable and deliver good quality food & drink (helpful staff!). Friendly ground-personnel and no need to run a marathon to reach the gate makes it a relaxing experience. Once you go though the security and passport check you seem to arrive in quite a different country all-together: 'tax-free' is a complete rip-off prices of salmon are triple(!) of that in Cork (same trademark and quantity) so duly you bleed for your families request. A cup of coffee at the bar suffers the same added-value while seemingly being made out a mixture of tarmac and dishwater here the personnel seems to be trained not to understand any language (I tried 3) and so ignoring my protest (he was probably rightfully to ashamed to respond). The permanent wind over the tarmac - Cork airport is on the top of a hill - blows you right in the direction of your plane.

The airport is fairly new and looks good. Departing is a whole different ball game and the time is spent mainly with the security checks so make sure you have plenty of time and I mean plenty of time. We arrived 3 hours prior to departure but it took us over 2 hours overall just to check in! Firstly queue to go through the ""interview"" i.e. why were you in Israel where are you going who were you with who packed your bag have you been given anything to carry on behalf of someone else etc etc. Wait time for us was approx 50 mins. Secondly queue for your bags go through a scan. Wait time for us was approx. 15 mins. Thirdly queue for your bag to be hand-searched. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins plus search time. Fourthly queue to check your bags in. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins. As much as security is of high importance the level of efficiency to move passengers was really poor e.g. ""interview"" staff would suddenly disappear leaving a long queue of people waiting around. Also don't think you can skip a security line either as you need all of the proper security bar codes before you can Check In. And the distance for all of the waiting around in - a mere 50m! Fifth queue for Immigration. This is where they really need some form of ""crowd control"" and manage their staff change overs. People were queuing in front of each individual Passport counter but when 2 of the staff left the remaining (long) queues became disorganised as they struggled to find another line to queue in for yet a different Immigration Officer. It would have been better if there had been a single queue and passengers directed to the next available counter. As for the rest of the airport well we really didn't experience much of it. Since Check In took so long we had to head straight to the Departure Gate. The only good thing - free wifi albeit for 30mins.

I travel to and from Samoa at least three times a year and I have yet to purchase anything from duty free. It's just so much more cheaper at other international airports - even taking into consideration the rate of the Samoan tala in foreign countries! Airport taxes are just so ridiculously high it's unbelievable. Look at the departure tax for instance - I remember when they lifted the tax to $30 and justified it to the public by claiming that children under a certain age did not have to pay tax. My husband and I have two children - an eighteen year old and a 4year old we still have to pay $120 which calculates to 'more' - 'much more' than the four of us would have to pay to get out of Auckland International Airport (even taking into consideration the Samoan tala exchange rate!). And I need not elaborate on the many luxuries (100 times over) that are available at the Auckland international airport and NOT available at the Faleolo airport! Once the tax hits the $40 mark you might as well include it in the ticket like everyone else around the world whose departure tax is over $30! We pay tax on our tickets and at the airport ... why not just put them together and leave them on the ticket! That would be one huge improvement - and less hassle when flynig out of faleolo!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Luckily I was able to call my wife as checking in a computer and a cellphone are not really an option. I can recommend the Paul stands at T1 and T2 for excellent sandwiches and amazing macaroons and pastries. We usually stock up there as the BA and Easyjet food is nothing to write home about.

As with most chinese airports it's rather recent with pretty efficient baggage claim. It's also relatively close to the city (ab 15 km) which means there are cheap (and crowded) regular buses and taxi will cost you maybe 50 yuan (5 €).

Only 6 desks open and hundreds and hundreds of people queuing right down the corridors leading to the hall. Visitors will hate the UK before they even step foot outside the airport.

Lack of special channel for European Union Residents existing in other airports. Flippant and inefficient attitude of passport controllers who appeared to be young and shallow. Numerous anxious passengers waiting in the queues who were ignored by the ground staff overlooking the queues. Security baggage checkers slow rude and careless with passenger's baggage literally throwing bags onto the floor to be rechecked. Many of them with a deficient level of English to facilitate the process. Surprising in Holland where most people have a good command of English! Enormous distance to reach connecting flight gate. I was heading to gate D87 at full speed when gate D56 was announced for my flight. I took no notice and a couple of minutes later they corrected themselves and said D87.

From the time you walk in the airport it environment is different from the typical airport facility. It has the comforting climate of a hotel while having all the stores of a mall. But not that is not all. Did I mention they have movie theatre gym game stations too? These are non- essential additions but that people can really appreciate. Passengers can be very tired and might have a few hours of layover. When an airport offers these kind of amenities it can make all the difference in the experience.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Russell Kaymer,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,North Terminal. Immigration queues are very long both for EU and ROW and Electronic. I arrived on the Emirates 380 on a UK Electronic passport. I waited 45m. The queues for EU and ROW were far worse and went all the way out of the hall down the corridor. The owners of this airport have increased capacity (Eg: Emirates now fly 2 x 380 into the airport and the airport is busier in the summer) but they have not spent the money on increasing the amount of desks or terminals. Surprise surprise the summer comes and Emirates upgauge and the waiting times go through the roof. I spoke to the Border force people who to be fair had all the desks open they said that they could not keep up with the throughput due to lack of desk and terminal space. Two thoughts: 1) Why do we give visitors and residents such a poor first impression of our country. 2) How can Gatwick possibly expect to add another runway if they cannot even cope with the one they already have? Furthermore the bridge connecting the terminal with the midfield gates does not appear to have been cleaned in a long time and their air bridge we used had litter strewn all over it. I couldn't help feeling that the whole LGW (N) arrival experience is hanging on a piece of thread. I used to opt to go to LGW as they spent a lot of money on the departure process and it worked now I go to LHR as the arrivals is much smoother.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
havana-airport,/airport-reviews/havana-airport,Havana Airport customer review,K McElroy,NA,2009-09-14,Havana Airport is small functional (but can be very slow) and little else. Arrivals (luggage delays aside) is ok getting out is a different story. At first it seems that check in etc is quite quick then you pay your 25cuc airport tax and then move to immigration. This can take hours staff disappear at a moments notice and its anybody's guess how long before they return time and time again this happened even when my passport/visa was being checked. As far as food/drink etc drinks are fine but food is poor and very expensive. Although it claims to be 24hr there is nothing open after 11pm (approx) so if you're delayed stock up. If you have problems with your flight being delayed etc. Dont expect any help you'll have to explain the same thing over and over again better off contacting the airline in your home country. Its worth noting that they have cardphones in the airport but nobody sells the cards there - I checked everywhere. So have a card on hand there are coin phones but pesos only and its very difficult to phone international. Also there is no internet access until after you go through check in/immigration (no wireless either). Basically : Get there 4hrs early double check the queues for check in have your visa immigration forms and 25cuc on hand and get a phone card before going to the airport just in case.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We arrived a bit over two hours before our flight and therefore were unable to get luggage tags. Instead we had to wait 20 minutes for the KLM people to arrive all the while watching the clock and the increasing lines at security. Also at the kiosk we had trouble getting the passport scanner to work and had to get the agent to come over and help. This was unnerving as she had to be contacted again for the second passport. Security was OK even though the line was long it moved must faster than in the US. It helped to have the video which let you anticipate what was needed. Shoes did not have to be removed.

The taxiways are in horrible condition and it felt like we were on a dirt road! After a bus ride to the terminal we were greeted with a dirty and very run down Terminal. The appearance that maintenance is never performed on this structure is obvious. Trash is everywhere (inside and out) the seating rows are going in all different directions and the walkways are filthy with windows you can barely see out of. Maintenance covers were half hanging from their remaining screws dust caked the vents and grunge lined the walls. The baggage claim area wasn't too bad and the wait reasonable. Airport staff/security was very rude. Getting from one Terminal to another or to the train station requires walking a maze of rundown walkways. Signage is adequate. The restrooms are filthy. Staff spend more time gossiping than actually cleaning. Upon departing check in was simple and security lines average. Maps showing the locations of food/shopping are non-existent. You must be willing to walk long distances to find food of any variety. The terminal advertises free internet but we could not get it to work. My arrival and departure were from Schegen Countries so I did not experience Customs. I will purposefully avoid this airport in the future.,NA,NA,NA,1,4,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

jiamusi-airport,/airport-reviews/jiamusi-airport,Jiamusi Airport customer review,Nick Fortuna,Australia,2009-07-04,JMU is located in the far north-east of China approx two hours' flying time from Beijing and three hours' flying time from Shanghai-Pudong. With a single runway doubling as the only taxiway JMU doesn't see much traffic. One has to walk across the runway to the terminal building - no provisions of covered walkways in this single-storey terminal building. Ok in summer but imagine in winter with -25 degrees. And it does get that cold up there - the Russian border is only a few hundred km away. The single belt means it can get crowded when a full China Southern 737 disgorges is complement of passengers. Trolleys are free but in a poor state. As soon as the airport staff matches luggage tag against baggage receipt means you're fair game for the taxi touts. Which is meaningless since they all use the meter. The drive into Jiamusi city is uneventful and mercifully only 50 RMB away. Departing on Hainan Airlines was easy - though the ticket counter accepts cash only should you need to purchase the ticket at the airport like we did. The two check-in clerks went about their job quickly and efficiently. Security was equally quick. The single departure hall consisted of two gates a souvenir shop selling Russian matrioshka dolls and manicure sets (!) and a smoking room. Again boarding was by walking across the aircraft parking bay. My only gripe were the taxi touts filthy toilets and lack of covered walkways.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Furthermore there are no parents rooms (baby change rooms) very few trolleys which are simply impossible to find very few restaurants or cafes to sit rest and refresh at with even less tables and chairs.

I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away.

Currently the airport is great to fly into great views as you come into land you go straight from the aircraft into the terminal building.

All inbound transit passengers must queue again in order go though security/Xray once more before going back down to the gate again. As everybody is on a short connect everyone seems to be irritated and close to panic in case they will miss their flights. The only ones not in stress are the security guards. So my question that nobody at MRS can ever answer is; if I have cleared security at a French airport (MRS) why do to I have to clear security again 10 mins after landing ?

The new terminal which opened earlier this year (now called Terminal 1) is light and airy with plenty of space and is clean and well airconditioned. I used the terminal last week to fly internally to Luxor on Egyptair and everything was clean and tidy. BA and other scheduled airlines (as well as charter flights to Moscow) use the new terminal. On the other side of the coin I flew in and out of Sharm on Monarch and like other European charter airlines they come in and out of the old terminal (now called Terminal 2). On Sunday afternoon it was a bun fight with appallingly insufficient numbers of seats for the passengers hoping to depart no semblance of a non-smoking area toilets which were pretty foul and very limited catering facilities. Spent two hours sitting on the floor reading a book while waiting for the flight. The additional money to fly BA might be worth it to use the nice terminal and avoid pins and needles.

President's Club could still use some updating/creature comforts but overall good experience. Biggest downer has to be the redcoat squadron that the airport employs. Clueless when it comes to directions current information etc. EWR is far superior to JFK and LGA for convenience cleanliness and the TSA security checkpoints.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I and my family have used LBA for over 15 years and it is now a disgrace! Luckily I checked my email 07/09/2014 to find the car park arrangements had changed. I prepaid for long stay parking usually insert credit card entering insert credit card on leaving and away you go. Now take a ticket on return from holiday your ticket MUST be verified at the extremely hard to find 'information' desk. What a debacle people who did not know about the last minute change were left stuck at the barrier creating queues both in and out. 50 minutes from landing to exiting one of the smallest airports in the world ridiculous. Facilities inside terminal are outdated dirty badly signed and a disaster if one has mobility/age issues.

The building is very small and displays a bizarre mixture of typical drab Soviet facilities and shiny renovated areas that you could almost call Scandinavian. Arriving at about 5 a.m on a red-eye flight I was greeted by a pack of stray dogs roaming the street outside the terminal but then I was able to wait for the first bus into town while having an excellent cappuccino in the new cafe inside the arrival area with plenty of seats and cheerful service from the very friendly staff. Immigration is the same as everywhere else in Russia even though this was the only place where I was asked to produce a copy of my invitation and health insurance. On an afternoon visit the departure sector which is located on the same level as the arrivals was almost deserted. Services on offer are scarce: one exchange office with ridiculously short opening times one Atm one cafe a couple of windows selling airline tickets and providing general information in Russian exclusively. Everywhere around the airport there are obvious signs of big renovation works going on I'm really curious to see what comes out of it in the future.

We had a 6 hour stop over on way to HK. KLIA is a totally different set up. Very spread out for shops and eateries. This really didn't bother me as such but there doesn't seem to be enough seating for passengers. I did like the free internet access and the chairs set up around the televisions so passengers could nap. I found retail terminal staff rude and as much as I'm an upbeat person and really value our service industry staff I was disappointed by seemingly everyone's attitude in thus airport. The cleanliness is an entirely different story. I was appalled at the state of the toilets they were below human standards of sanitation. We visited several toilet blocks and found them all similar. Shape up KLIA the Western Tourist has demands and simple hygiene should be an absolute given a lot of other International airports are meeting their guests needs. Follow suit.

Its a great place to stop for the night the only concern is if you are to arrive into Terminal D (United Airlines/Delta/American etc) you always expect about 30-45 minute wait for your luggage to arrive at the baggage claim. You would be advised not to bother rushing off the plane and down to the tram which takes you to the main terminal as you will only end up waiting for ages for your luggage to arrive. Take your time.. Vegas is also notorious for losing bags. The free wireless internet is a bonus though just need to enter your email adress (very safe). You SHOULD take the freeway if you're going downtown; and maybe the extreme north strip (Stratosphere area.) The freeway may also be the best route to off-strip properties such as Rio Gold Coast and the Palms. But if you're staying in the popular mid to south strip area (between Mandalay Bay on the south and Wynn Venetian or Treasure Island on the north) the freeway just adds unnecessary mileage and about $5 extra to the fare. The honest cabbie will take Swenson to Tropicana and then either Koval Lane or Paradise to an east strip property (Paris & Ballys area) or Las Vegas Blvd. or Industrial Ave. for west strip properties (Caesars Monte Carlo Mirage etc.) Taking the freeway loops you around the south side of the airport and then takes you about a half mile west of the strip so you have to double back to the strip""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Transiting was a hassle as mentioned by others before. There are long queues at security and probably due to Asian Games they will frisk everyone. The worst part is the smoking areas at the international departure are a serious design flaw. There is no separate room with proper separate ventilation system. The smoking areas are just designated corners right next to the washrooms nursing rooms and drinking water! Worse there is one smoking area for every two boarding gates. All the international holding areas for the boarding gates are filled with putrid smoke. While my family with children were waiting there for 4 hours waiting in transit we had to escape to somewhere near the immigration counter further away from the boarding gates.

Check in was alright although queues at the BA/IB counters can be long since the autocheckin machines never seem to work properly. Connecting to the Satellite terminal can seem like a lot but the train is fast and literally took 2 minutes from security- the queues of which can vary from non existent to horribly chaotic- to the train station in the lower levels. The Satellite is identical to the main building but in a much more human scale. No calls to board which is partly good because the airport is quiet but bad because you need to check the screens constantly -though these are plentiful throughout the airport. Shopping is good in the main terminal but bad in the satellite though you get pretty much the same offer in terms of restaurants/cafes. IB's VIP lounge has improved a lot though - finally there's WiFi! Airport was clean.

Even if the boards had shown the correct gate I am sure we could not have got there on time. The very routine approach from staff was to get us out of the secure zone purchase a new ticket and show us a hotel list while we wait for tomorrow's flight. Even as we strolled through without a queue on a quiet Monday I noticed the time interval between your go to gate message and take off is suspiciously short. The lack of planning and basic convenience of departing from here is more than laughable: I suspect it is intended to hinder you and cause you additional costs.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2010-10-22,Used the new T3 international terminal during a recent trip. You no longer have to deal with the masses outside the entrance doors much more space to move around the check-in area and the security check has been moved to immediately after immigration meaning you no longer have to worry about missing your flight due to security if you go to the lounge. The main terminal area is much nicer than the old one though as another poster has noted the shops are overpriced lounges are nicer as are gate waiting areas. Queue control also seems to be better though I was leaving on a Saturday night when traffic seemed pretty light. Alas there are still some teething problems. My main complaint was the shuttle service from the domestic terminal (1D) to the international terminal. The bus itself is fine but you're dropped off at the very bottom level where there are no luggage carts to be found. This forces you to lug your heavy bags up a seemingly endless series of travelators to the 3rd level - no easy feat when you're tired. There is still insufficient place to sit if you arrive too early to check in for your flight. And although Wi-Fi is free you must have a working mobile phone to obtain a password by SMS - a big problem if you're a visitor without an international-enabled phone. They don't even offer a pay option anymore. And finally I don't care for the gate setup - similar to Bangkok or Singapore where you have a second (useless) security check then a waiting area to sit until your flight is ready to board but the waiting area itself doesn't open until about an hour before boarding. If you're too early there's really no place to sit in the main terminal unless you have lounge access or patronize one of the overpriced restaurants.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Firstly, its a long way out of the city. We used a fixed price taxi, which cost 15 Euro, but it will easily be 25 to 30 Euros from the city centre. On arrival we were met with a Departure Board, that only showed a handful of flights. We had to dodge lines to eventually find where we needed to check in. I am just thankful we arrived early. We stood for 30 minutes on what was a short line of people (clerk was simply slow), to find that we could only weigh the luggage and get the tags and that we had to drop off the suitcases at another part of the airport. No signs anywhere to show you where drop off was. The Terminal is small, and lines so long, we had to fight to through lines of people to find the bag drop. Once there, we had another 40 minute wait and a line that snaked around half the airport, just to drop off the bag. Crazy! Next another 30 minute queue to go through security. Rude staff and poor organisation sum up this experience. As we were flying to a non Schengen country, we had to use a small lounge on the other side of passport control, which was so full we had to stand. The toilets were disgusting and the only shop was a coffee bar, whose young employee was on a go slow. To reach the aircraft you have to use stairs and buses.

The cleaning machines were strangely comforting and while the airport doesn't have too many overnight dwellers it could do with a snack/coffee bar that is open all night. Everything else was fine it could just use either a lounge (I had heard of one but I think this was just airside) or some double layer entry points (to limit heat loss) or some heating just for the few months that Macau may need it. Perhaps the airport could work with some of the nearby hotels/casinos to accommodate transit passengers - that would make for a more memorable night than just freezing on an airport seat!

Arrival is uncomplicated (no jetways and a short walk to the terminal) although travelers should be aware that the luggage trolleys are only for the use of porters unlike other airports. Taxis await outside the baggage claim. Check-in is more complicated. The first departure area one encounters is actually where ticketed passengers go to reach their gate.

The airport appears to be in a state of protracted renovation that is evident at departure - a regular visitor commented that it was different every time he visited there so conditions may change. The security is pretty simple - no removing of watches etc. The gate area is a bullpen and the monitors provide the names of airlines but no departure information.

After a third-degree interrogation - at the age of 67 (as shown in my Australian passport) - I think I had 90% convinced her that no I did not intend to work in the UK. To make sure I said: ""Look if you really want I will show you my UK passport but I wanted to enter and leave as an Aussie"". Grudgingly she stamped my Australian passport. Welcome to Britain. No matter how much money the English Tourist Board spends on promotion it's the initial impression that counts. The UK Border Agency needs to lift its game.

We then used the rail service to get into Stuttgart which was excellent. On our return the check-in staff at the Germanwings desk were most pleasant and efficient. No long queues at security and the place was spotlessly clean. The only gripe would be the fantastically high prices at the bars and cafes.

Latest was yesterday at 3 o clock in the morning. I waited more than 2 hours. Automatic passport control for Thai nationals. And they assigned the same amount of passport gates for Tourists. Not even considering that the percentage of Tourists is probably 90% whereas the number of Thai's travelling was around 10%. So the airport invested a lot of money for bringing down the time for Thai's from 4 minutes to 1 minute instead of focusing on the real problem which is just getting worse and worse!,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Very efficient. Tourist information by the arrivals hall directed me to the Finnair bus. For EUR5.90 this took me to the main railway station in Helsinki. On the return journey the Finnair bus dropped passengers off right outside the terminal. Check-in and passport security very quick and staff polite. However the departure area is just too small for the number of passengers. The gate areas have enough seating for about 20 passengers so everyone else spills out into the shopping and dining area which dominate the terminal. Not enough toilets but generally clean.

My wife's belt set off the security metal detector alarm but the security staff were busy looking elsewhere in the chaos and didn't notice. Check in lines were another long wait. Passport control only had 2 staff on so another 20 min wait there. My son wasn't visible to the passport control officer but that didn't stop his passport being stamped by an officer clearly in a hurry. The policeman/officer who checks that you have a passport stamp before moving to the next stage couldn't find my stamp but the queue was so long he just waved us through not checking any of our 4 passports. There are more (duplicated) security checks to get to the gates but this was equally lax and might as well not have been there. The fellow supposed to be watching the xray screen was talking to his mates. We had 15 minutes to rest at the gate before boarding.

Never again 3 pints of lager 2 fantas and a small bottle of water cost Â£49. We were utterly shocked but should have realised the moment we entered the bar as there were only another couple of people there. The prices at the fast food outlets was also extortionate. We had the foresight to take sandwiches and soft drinks with us although had to drink liquids before customs ( wish we had had similar foresight for the airport bar!). The airport was also very stuffy hardly any aircon. I felt so sorry for parents with small children as they would have definitely needed drinks. Also agree with reviews regarding lack of seating downstairs. The airport authorities really need to sort this out.

Customs was a bit tedious but again the queue kept moving and was not too long merely on one pass through very disorganised. I had read the horror stories on here but some of the queuing will depend upon arrival time compared to other incoming arrivals and how quickly you get off your aircraft.

Arrived from Prague on a late night easyjet flight landed at around 2250 at the South Terminal the same day when the UK security level was raised to severe. When we disembarked the plane we realized that the door between the jetty and the terminal was closed and there was no one inside the airport. We then managed to ask the flight attendant to help and managed the first door. Then we realized there was another second door locked. Again no sign of any staff at Gatwick. The flight attendant had to open the door again and here we are at the departure lounge rather than the arrivals. Then all the passengers wander around the almost empty airport without being approached or questioned. Eventually I managed to get the attention from a security personnel and he directed all the passengers though the arrival hall. No explanation whatsoever. They blamed easyjet of course.

The ""Plane Train"" is large fast and very frequent and the new LED/LCD display inside the train cars looks great.

I usually try to avoid having to go through security during peak hours on Monday mornings (even priority lanes get very long). Other times aren't bad but priority lanes sure do help a lot. ""TSA pre"" is also available in South Terminal which I heard is more faster and convenient than priority lanes ( haven't personally used that yet but colleagues of mine did). Baggage is also handled quite well. Never had a lost/delayed baggage when checked in at ATL. I've noticed many new exhibits/art works being displayed around the airport (not sure if it is to encourage local artists or anything but surely beats walking past lame advertisements or promotions).

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Kris Ho,Hong Kong,2015-01-19,The arrival experience at SYD was slightly better than departure. Arriving Sydney from BKK holding a British passport made my life better with the new e-channel introduced (first time using) it was fast and just a few clicks and let you go. After clearing immigration and collecting my bags head to the customs with nothing to declare it was really a hassle-free experience. Departing from SYD to HKG with a 'fast track pass' which really didn't mean a thing. Staff at the immigration queue just direct passengers without that fast pass going to the fast pass area which I needed to follow behind those 'normal' passenger. I think they really should review on such policy. Immigration officers are friendly and the gate area is really congested. It was all packed with pax on Korean Air Cathay Jetstar Qantas which was difficult for me to get a seat nearby the gate area!

I was prepared for a hard time in an airport which has not attracted good (or even adequate) reviews but it was not too bad. Upon arrival (mid morning) my only comment would be that Immigration was heavily overloaded although they did their best to process us as fast as possible. Luggage delivery time was quite reasonable. We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Miranda Walker,NA,2008-03-10,With regard to domestic terminal congestion - WAC (airport administrator) is aware of the problems and work has been continuing over the last year or so to improve things- this has included extra aircraft bays at the domestic terminal 2 (Virgin Skywest) and a new parking area to the north end which frees up taxiways etc during peak times. The problem with Perth was the 20-year plan did not anticipate the phenomenal increase in flights hence the congestion at peak times (5-8am & 3-7pm) I agree it's taken far too long to address the problems- a multi-storey car park seems the ideal solution - however it seems the airport is more interested in building commercial buildings. Have read reports of a planned spur line from Bayswater station on the Midland train line to the airport to (finally) link the airport to the rail network. If driving to the international airport during peak times avoid intersection of Leach Hwy & Roe Hwy - if coming from south on Roe better to go Abernethy Rd take a left at Grogan road- this takes you through the warehouse/back areas and eventually joins up with Horrie Miller Drive.

However The current owners need to start showing some improvement in the infrastructure for their extra income. My pet hate about Prestwick: What idiot thought of closing two of three lanes to traffic in front of the terminal and banning drop-offs / pick ups?

The one thing you'll notice upon getting in or out of the terminal is the crowd control - you don't have to fight through the thousands of gawkers that normally congest the entry gates. The check-in area is spacious and unlike other airports in India you don't have to get your bags pre-screened before going to the check-in counter. Security check is a breeze and there is a better selection of shops and restaurants than the old airport (albeit badly overpriced). The terminal building itself is clean airy and bright with adequate seating at the gate areas and has clean modern bathroom facilities. The negatives - the distance from the city the exorbitant parking fees (300 rupees just for your driver to wait for you) high prices for food and drinks in the terminal and the bags take a good while to get to the carousels.

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I am at this airport almost every other weekend and this will be my first review with them. 1) Check in is a breeze. Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full. The cars are unorganised and everyone looked lost. I know they are building a new airport to support the high amount of tourists coming into the country, so I really am looking forward to that.",Arrival and Departure,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,6,2,2,2,NA,3,1,3,NA,0

The ticket counter check in is old style and cramps the terminal area if heavy flights are queuing. Alaska is the only airline there that I know of with kiosk check in. Security is bad TSA staff is rude compared to other airports. Security area is cramped and not efficient. Long walks to the gate areas except for Alaska who is the main tenant here. There are two satellite terminals connected by an underground tram. International runs out of the south satellite. After customs you have to put your bags on the conveyer then go to baggage claim in the main terminal to reclaim them. Parking is a mess. Rental cars are currently in the parking garage but plans are to move them away which will mean shuttles to and from. Food services are the only bright spot here.

Many mornings I leave my home in central Berlin less than an hour before departure park my car right under the gate and within minutes I have received my boarding pass either from an e-kiosk or from the mostly considerate and friendly check-in staffers. I often have even time to pick-up a newspaper and drink a quick fruit juice in the lounge. The highly efficient security check at each and every gate is another big advantage compared to other airports and it is better than the the ones in Munich or Frankfurt.

On route to Vancouver there was no connecting flight on same day so airline put me up at Miramar Golf Country Club Hotel in Taipei (very nice! also gives you a chance to see a bit of Taipei as it's about 30mins shuttle from airport). Actually thought I'd be put up in the Transit Hotel (located inside Terminal 2) but for some reason was not. Miramar was so lovely that I'm definitely not complaining. Wasn't so lucky on the way back (7 hour stopover in Taipei) Tried to get into the China Airlines lounge but was informed it's only for Business and First Class - and they won't even let you pay to try it. My hopes of getting a shower were quickly diminishing. Was directed to the Transit Hotel up an elevator past this ""dragons in the clouds"" wall display. Honestly just follow the signs to the transit hotel there are plenty. If you get lost just ask someone their english isn't always good but they understand ""transit hotel"" and will happily point you in the right direction. The transit hotel charges US$10 for a shower which also gives you the use of their lounge for 2 hours (where you can help yourself to some coffee or tea or jump on the internet for free). The shower facilities are minimal with a small locker made available for your stuff a towel shower cap toothbrush and toothpaste provided. There are about 6 shower cubicles and a sauna (which costs marginally extra) in this one room with shower gel and ""conditioning shampoo"" (not the best quality by a long shot but it will suffice) provided. For US$36 you can have the use of a hotel room for 3 hours (US$12 for every hour over that). Another thing worth mentioning is that CKS has no ATMs inside the terminal you actually have to go out past security if you want to find one (which isn't really worth it). And Subway doesn't do EFTPOS (nor do they take coins!) So make sure you have at least US$20 cash on you (in notes preferably) and eat first before you spend your last $10 on a shower.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The queues went through the terminal and out through the door. Because of delays in security an airport employee patrolled the Fast Lane calling out flight times to take people out of the queue into the Fast Lane. This is not efficient as the estimated time to get through security has been seriously underestimated by the employee. When we finally got through security we were refused embarkation at the departure gate as this had closed. There are four basic problems at Terminal 1: 1) Too many early morning flights. 2) Security is understaffed and extremely inefficient. 3) Because of high aircraft charges for checked in bags more hand luggage is having to be checked in. 4) When you finally manage to clear Security you then have to fight your way through the Duty Free area to try and get to the departure gates in time.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Food and drink wise there is a cafe/bar landside and some sort of Taverna outside but all you have airside is a smallish outlet serving sandwiches/pies and drinks (if you're lucky) and unbelievably doesn't accept cards of any type. Worse than that there is no allocated seating beyond a few small stands. Just to round things off the staff were rude and miserable. There is no cash machine airside nor is there a drinking fountain should you get thirsty and have no Euros. On top of that you are packed in with far too many people for the seating available. There are a couple of duty free shops. Thankfully there is air conditioning or it would be pretty unbearable. If you are a smoker then get your fix before you go through security if you have a long wait for your flight as there is no smoking anywhere. Note take no notice of your holiday rep telling you to queue outside. It'll be boiling hot and there is nothing to stop you waiting in the air conditioned terminal or going to the cafe upstairs. A pretty poor show for such a busy (at least in season) airport. Corfu is not some small little island that only sees a flight a day and it should have an airport that is appropriate to modern needs.

They tell you the airline should give you an orange pass and if you do not have one they cannot help you. When you finally get through to baggage handlers have taken the baggage off and it's all over the floor. Go to connecting flights they just rip of your bag tags and tell you to go outside and to the left. When you do that you will be greeted with AA rebooking. The person manning the queue will pay no attention to your ticket that he inspects and will direct you to stand in an economy class rebooking queue when you have a first class ticket. Wait another hour and you will be greeted by an AA agent that will ask why you missed you connection and then blame you and make a big deal about rebooking. After you have been told how grateful you should be to them for rebooking you you will be sent on your way to find a hotel at your own expense. Do not try and argue that your flight came in late (even if it did) as the agent won't have it. My flight landed 2 minutes late but took another 35 minutes to get on stand because we were waiting for another aircraft to move. The AA agent will firmly tell you the flight was not late because two minutes is not late and the computer will show the time the wheels hit the tarmac not the arrival on stand.

My wife and I had an early flight and could not check-in online so had to arrive at a time when it would have been pointless to book a hotel room. We were not the only ones in this situation but all of us were herded to the most draughty place in the terminal and forced to sit on uncomfortable metal seats all night even though there were more comfortable seats nearby. We could have paid to use a ""lounge"" area but on investigation this was found to be a dark dingy airless space barely more comfortable than in the terminal. A security check was carried out on all those waiting and we were issued with wristbands so restricting our comfort in this way is completely unreasonable. Some passengers tried to get some sleep laying on the floor but were woken up and forced to move by the security staff. The excuse for this? We would be safer if there was another earthquake!

I continued to struggle through the queue but my luggage was delayed and checked. I advised operator that I was in danger of missing my flight and asked if they could check it more quickly (in hindsight probably not a good move as this did not speed up the process). Once I had come through security had to get through everyone milling around the shops to get to gate 57 - a crazy system of going up and down escalators. I felt sorry for those who had to use the lifts. I missed my boarding time there was no one to assist with exit from the departure lounge.

new-york-jfk-airport,/airport-reviews/new-york-jfk-airport,New York JFK Airport customer review,J Hook,United Kingdom,2013-11-25,Returned from NYC recently and so disgusted with the service forced to provide a review. Six adults and a two year old amongst the group arrived into JFK airport off a flight with Delta (which went very well). The terminal building is made out of glass and this results in a greenhouse effect in the terminal building it was absolutely boiling and we were herded into snaking lines. We waited for approximately 30 minutes when the two year old became very restless we asked one of the ten or so members of staff standing around chatting if we could come through the lines (this had been done automatically for us in Heathrow and was very unexpected). One member of staff said no another said the child and the parents can come though then a third said no you can all come through. We left our place in the line and proceeded to a desk set up for special assistance at this point a fourth member of staff said no only the child and parents can come through the rest will need to go back in the line. This lady was so rude and aggressive the rest of our party proceeded to return to the back of the line. The two parents and the child then went through immigration with the rudest disinterested most tired and unhelpful unwelcoming member of staff I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. The really laughable thing about this is the fact that they have signs stating that they want to provide positive experiences. Had we known we would be separated we would have endured the line had we known that immigration would be as bad as this we would have used a different airport. The child and parents proceeded to baggage claim and waited a further three hours before the rest of our party came through. To make people wait in line with no water or any forms of communication is really unacceptable in the year 2013 I have personally travelled to countries considered third world by the US and have been treated far better than this. Had we not had a child with us we would have been happy to wait in line however asking anyone to wait in a green house for three hours just to pass through immigration is disgusting and I will never fly into this airport again. We had been given exceptional service in Heathrow and departing from JFK was much better however the lack of any organisation and rudeness of staff in JFK did not give a very good first impression of the United States.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Aircraft was parked up very near the terminal building and we were really impressed with the North Terminal and said how happy we would be to fly from there again. On our return it was a different story. Aircraft was at farthest gate which meant an extremely long walk for us. I would say it was a mile and a half but the official distance is 840m to passport control. Whatever it was it was too long to expect people to walk. There should be transport for those who would prefer it. I did phone before we left home and requested assistance but was then asked if we could walk 500m. I explained that yes we could but as we had both had recent operations we found it hard to stand queuing. We were told that there was no assistance available to us as we could walk 500m and in any case we would still have to stand and queue for passport control or baggage drop etc. On arrival back to Gatwick there was no-one to ask for help although we passed many little trucks just parked up with no driver.

The officer told me that they'd been having problems with the iris scanner rejecting people and they didn't know why.

orlando-sanford-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-sanford-airport,Orlando Sanford Airport customer review,Lasse Skou,NA,2005-10-20,I am a check in agent at Sanford and I am glad to hear some positive feedback from passengers. Orlando Sanford International started to receive a lot of international charters in 1996 with close to 614000 passengers during this year. Today we handle around 1 million international passengers and close to 800000 domestic passengers a year. That is a lot for such a little airport especially are the international numbers since we mainly have passengers from March through October only. On most airports in the US the airlines have to pay a penalty if the aircraft arrive early or late based on the scheduled slot time they hve been given. Our airport does not charge for that. As the slots have been prepared so that everything will run pretty smooth problems occur as the aircraft diviate from their slots. When suddenly 6-8 aircrafts arrive at their gates within 30 min things takes time to process. It may take you up to 45 min to 1 hours sometimes to be checked in. Again congestion happens due to late/early busses. It can within 15 minutes arrive 6 busses or 360 passengers and check in time increases. One airline offer check in at a facility in Orlando/Kissimmee opening 7am 'til 1230pm for a small fee. Then you can arrive at the airport 90 minutes before departure. This airport is a good option for an airline to use since it offers low rates for landing and ground handling. These days airline-industry is very competitive and with high gasoline prices still offer UK passengers fares to Florida starting at 200-300 US dollars which often also includes a rental car.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Robert Nash,United Kingdom,2013-10-07,This is my local airport and I am ashamed of it. The latest changes have made the travel experience worse. You start off with a crowded drop off point that also doubles as a collection point and it just leads to chaos. The drop off point should be near the departure zone as most people being dropped off are going to catch a flight. You then start the first long trek with your luggage and perhaps children. If your unlucky your operator (Thomson) has a sign at the check in desk stating all flights which will then guarantee you standing watching people queue jump as their flight is boarding before yours (we stood for 45 mins watching this). Then you negotiate the security section which can either be straight forward or another stressful windup. I managed to get my belt camera wallet coat keys and travel bag back pretty quick but I was puzzled where my shoes went. I stood waiting for 5 minutes and they just disappeared whilst even more people passed through. The next windup came as we had to walk through duty free shops and stalls which seem to be taking over where there used to be more seating and refreshment area. We had booked to wait in the Service Air lounge which had now been relocated since last year. Another disaster but I will take that up with them. Now this is where it gets stupid. Your gate is announced on the departure screen and you could start one the longest walks of you life in a small airport. We walked for ages along an upper corridor to find the gate. We then negotiated about 30 steps to a holding area which was packed with our fellow Thomson 757 passengers (about 233 people). So this whole new building protect left us walking along distance negotiating stairs and still walking out over the airport apron to queue in the elements onto the steps of the plane. The return flight was just a rerun of the out bound experience. Out of the plane down the steps into the rain the walk across the apron up the 30 steeps and the walk that felt I was going suddenly to appear at Bristol City center. I really felt for those fellow passengers who had any difficulty walking or those with young children (as you hand in your pushchair and don't get it back until luggage reclaim). Judging by the other passengers £2 to hire a luggage trolley must be a joke as they were more than likely free where you flew out of your departure airport. Air travel is supposed to become better!

We use off airport parking so can't comment on the airport arrangements but there seemed to be plenty of well regulated space for drop-offs right outside given that it was a quiet day. Nice building: a bit like a small T5 at LHR with an uncluttered and spacious arrivals hall. However finding our airline check-in desk was a challenge as a computer failure had cut off all the electronic displays at the desks and not one staff member we approached knew where BA checked-in! We found them at the back around the corner and once there the procedure was fast friendly and efficient. Passports and security checks were just fine although they took longer and were more thorough than at the old terminal; better be safe than sorry though. We then searched for a departures display to keep an eye on the time and found just one tucked around a corner by the loos. There may have been more but at least this one was working. On to the shops and the cafes. Elegant but extremely expensive a growing trait in Cyprus regrettably and not all the fault of the exchange rate. I don't think £4 is a fair price for a coffee nor £6 for a roll and you could beat the prices for most items in the duty free in local shops. Call forward and the bridge to the aircraft were just fine and a marked improvement on the cattle market and bus at the old terminal. Overall? A good start but how will it perform in the holiday season?,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,P Edelstein,United States,2012-04-24,This is without question the most miserable airport I've used in the US. Airport is seemingly ancient with very poor layout and huge security lines. One TSA person went out of her way to be nasty while others were reasonable.

Use Manchester as preference to a trip via London but not out of choice more ease. Escalators and moving walkways out of order unhelpful security and long lines with no thought for passenger care and service cleaning poor and Border control with permanent queues on your return.

The check in desk closed half way through check in when the clerk walked with no explanation. They didn't advise us so after a while we asked if someone was coming back. No they were not so we then had to re-queue at another desk. Baggage security check was also chaos and the attendent rude - throwing our bags into the Xray scanner before we could close it! Felt the taxis were a rip off at 200 Dirhams for a 15 minute ride from our hotel by the medina. They won't let you use your last Dirhams in the airport shops so you then have to take them home and convert back at a terrible rate loosing maybe 25% of the value.

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,Arthur Jackson,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,It really puzzles me why how this airport can so consistently get departures right and yet consistently make arrivals such a nightmare. I've rarely queued for check in or security which is so much better these days. The departure lounge is reasonable with plenty of choice for a relatively small airport. What annoys without fail is their arrivals handling. Maybe it's because there is less opportunity for financial gain from arriving passengers (although their charges for baggage trolleys might suggest otherwise). I've never found immigration anything but busy that is on a good day. On a bad day the place is heaving with passengers queuing up the stairs to the gate concourse. Problems are caused when passengers use the lift to reach immigration leaving them with no option but to push into the queue. One might assume that after the time taken to clear immigration at least your bags would be merrily enjoying their carousel ride. Rarely is this the case. Why is this airport so slow at getting bags to belt? Sure every airport has occasional delays but Birmingham seems to have nothing but delays when it comes to the arrival experience. Odd as you'd think the airport would want the passengers last memory of the airport to be a good one obviously they don't otherwise they would resolve the issues. The airport seems to be hell bent on expanding but seem to be unable to cope with the arrivals they already have.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

kazan-airport,/airport-reviews/kazan-airport,Kazan Airport customer review,Barry Byrne,NA,2007-05-27,Kazan Airport has two terminals but T2 a square shaped building some 50m from T1 seems to be used mainly as a VIP facility. Terminal 1 is a small rectangular building with separate sections for international and domestic services. Most likely it is the international section you will encounter on the regular LH service from FRA that arrives / departs in the very early morning. To say that Kazan has few facilities for departing passengers is rather an understatement a preliminary baggage scan leads immediately to a few check in desks and a very short walk to immigration control and a further scan for hand baggage. In the small waiting area there are some hard seats in a small waiting room and a bar. The business lounge has a few soft seats a fish tank and a television. Drinks here even coffee are to be paid for nothing is free apparently. There are no shops banking or change facilities at departure. They bus you the 20m to the aircraft of course. On the plus side this very small facility is a pleasant change from the corridors of FRA but not a place to linger to arrive too early or any place to be delayed either. It is a reasonably long way from the city but linked by a good road so it does not take very long to travel to the city. At that hour of the morning the roads are empty also.

He told me where to find the bus stop (easy enough) but there was no timetable! I got a taxi instead. Departure was rather more troublesome - I had checked in for both flights in Sydney so didn't need the check-in facilities at CBR but finding a seat that was out of the quite fierce sun was rather difficult. Food prices were also high ($6.50 for two sandwiches $3.50 for a small bottle of soft drink). Then when I went through the scanner for security everything I was wearing set it off! I had to take off my belt then my shoes but it still beeped because I have metal pins in my feet. When I asked why I had not had any similar problem at SYD I was told ""our scanner is more sensitive!"" Way too sensitive is more like it.

You can get to France through the Swiss side terminal - just collect your luggage in the main bagage hall go out into the Swiss side and then walk upstairs (to the left I think) through a small door and you are in France! There is a place for someone to check your passport but I have never seen anyone there. The French side is much less crowded and has a full set of (albeit fewer) check in desks so you can check in and leave your luggage here without a long wait but be warned - you need a boarding card to go from France to Switzerland in the terminal so you can't go back to the Swiss side once you have left - make sure you have all your children with you! I have no idea if there is any public transport or taxis on the French side - probably not - but there is a full set of car hire booths (if you hire on the French side you must bring it back to the French side otherwise Herz or whoever will charge you lots of money to move the car about 100m). There are lots of shops selling pricy watches and chocolate and a reasonably good duty free - before security - but the cafes in the departure satellites (after the security has removed your drinks) are horrendously expensive - €3 for a small bottle of water anyone - but aside from that the only problem is the lack of seating downstairs however if you go upstairs near the frequent fliers lounges (follow sign for chapel) the lounges are usually empty.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However if you come to this airport with a connecting flight to the US it actually has a US immigration station so you do not need to pass immigration in actual US territory.

People who get frustrated sneak into the separate line for people with tight connections. While our flight was going to board in 45 minutes the people assured us that we wouldn't miss our flight. Organization was lacking and they ended up making a longer line for everybody who needed to get into a 5.00pm flight. It was extremely busy yet only 2 lanes for security were open.

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,J Body,United Kingdom,2013-11-05,We flew home from here after a recent holiday. We had flown out of London Heathrow and found the contrast quite surprising. Upon arrival we self checked our bags which was fairly straightforward. We were then unsure which way to go for security. One member of staff directed us to the wrong place but we eventually found where to go. There was a long queue although it did move reasonably quickly - it probably took about 15 minutes. One thing that surprised us was that under 12s or over 70s did not need to remove their shoes for security checks - surely if someone is a risk everyone is a potential risk no matter their age? Once on the concourse we were unsure where to go and wait. There is basically a long corridor with a few shops and nowhere to sit other than the departure gates. We therefore had 3 hours to kill and not a lot to fill the time with. I would have happily browsed a shopping area and probably spent some money on last minutes gifts. It also felt odd having no designated sitting area prior to our gate being open. Not a user friendly airport considering the amount of time you need to spend there.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,J Christie,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,Marseille MP2 is frankly a bit of a pit - presumably the airlines that use it benefit from reduced fees which they pass on to customer. Definitely feels like the steerage option and I shudder to think how this works for the very old the very young and those with reduced mobility for disabilities whether temporary or permanent. Felt like a visit to a DIY store with service on same basis. It feels as if there is a complicit acceptance of you have paid your money and made your choice about this place. The only positive to the recent air traffic controller strike in June is that we took an Easyjet flight to Nice instead of MP2 - I had been warned by a friend who flew last year but my wife and I were still surprised on our return leg. Good reason for looking at BA flights next time provided one can book in advance and get a decent fare of course.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,L Chan,United States,2010-03-07,Flew out of Newark to Houston on Continental out of Terminal C. Was as decent as a major airport can get. Took about 45 minutes to clear security. It was much faster and TSA was more polite then JFK Terminal 5. It was clean and I made it to my gate just as they started boarding which was a little tight but as it was my first time flying out of Newark and I was estimating time based on security clearance time at Los Angeles International and Burbank Airport. My one issue with the airport was that an emergency door got pushed open at some point and they just left the fire alarm going and going and going - and going. From when I got in line for security til when I cleared it was still going.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
incheon-airport,/airport-reviews/incheon-airport,Incheon Airport customer review,H S Lee,South Korea,2013-06-13,Used this airport to visit Seoul from the US using United. Flight used the midfield concourse and passengers had to use the shuttle train to reach the main terminal for immigration baggage claim and customs. Got off the plane at 9pm on a rainy Monday night: 2-minute walk to reach the shuttle train station 1-minute wait to get on the train 2-minute ride to reach the main terminal 2-minute walk to arrive at immigration 15 seconds to pass immigration (eligible to use the kiosk being a Korean citizen) 5-minute wait to claim all checked bags 10 seconds to pass customs and I was walking for the Airport Express station. Altogether only about 13 minutes despite arriving at the midfield concourse passing through immigration claiming 2 bags and passing through customs. Even the worst luck with gate assignment would have taken only 3 additional minutes for me and even for foreigners who cannot use the automated immigration kiosks would have completed all the steps within 30 minutes. In conclusion quite an impressive airport just with its speedy processing for most passengers. Add to this a bunch of other factors that has been talked about quite a few times over the Internet and this airport is quite obviously one of the best airports in the world.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,C Wright,Spain,2012-12-17,Recently flew into Luton airport from Alicante. Although I am a very frequent flyer it is the first time I have encountered the new passport checking system. Which is in itself an excellent idea. However the visual description of how to use them is not great! There was one man trying his best to assist people. After showing my passport I then had to pass into the next section but the gate did not open? I then heard a man yelling at me that I should come back and stand on the picture of the feet (which I had not seen because I was looking into the lens which scans your face) he then shouted to myself and other customers that 'it was not rocket science'. At this point I realised that it was a security guard leaning with his colleague outside the barriers shouting. I made my objection to the security guard about how he was treating people for which I received no apology he merely stated that he was not shouting at me but someone else. I was then told to 'go away' both verbally and with a wave of the hands! I have yet to find out what training airport security receive at Luton airport but surely basic manners and general politeness are an essential part of any job when dealing with the public.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Wendy R London,New Zealand,2013-08-20,Comments apply only to the Domestic Transfer desk at AKL - the rest of the operation at AKL is excellent. My husband and I arrived at AKL on EK 406 (First Class) on 8 August and once we cleared customs with our luggage went to the transfer desk to check-in and leave our luggage for our domestic connection NZ 445 to WEL. There was one family group of 4 ahead of us and one person at the check-in desk (a second one soon arrived). The desk agent refused to check us in telling us that we had to use one of the two check-in kiosks. At the time the family were attempting to use both kiosks and were having trouble the desk agent still refused to manually check us in saying that if that family could do it so could we. The desk agent still refused to help despite the fact that even by then there was no one else in the queue. My concerns are: There are only 2 kiosks and their position â€“ make it very difficult for more than one or two people to queue up to use it. Unlike the domestic terminal there are no staff members positioned near the kiosks to help. My great fear is the congestion which would occur if the remaining pax from our A380 had reached the transfer desk at that time or indeed if more than one aircraft landed at the same time producing more transfer pax. Upon arriving at AKL we had just flown 15 hours not including our MEL lay-over. Frankly we were too tired to have to deal with horrifically sub-standard customer service. This complaint is not about being a premium pax or a non-premium pax. It is about a serious lack of customer service for all passengers transferring at our major gateway airport.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups.

Fortunately there wasn't the scrum that I had recently read about. There were no queues at either immigration customs or VAT refund which was great. I think this was only because it was Monday and very few people were around anyway. The Immigration guy was extremely rude to the point of yelling at me when I mistakenly asked him to stamp my VAT refund forms. Next was the customs guy who was not at all happy that I should bother him to stamp my VAT forms. I was polite and used my limited Italian to say please and thank you.

In the good old days one could take walking sticks on board the aircraft - now one has the indignity of having to put them in the hold with the subsequent delay of 1 hour to retrieve them. I have watched the baggage handlers from the terminal and in anyone's language they are so slow - they make a snail seem fast. Staff walking around with arms around each other and continual chatting as if customers do not exist. My process this time was appalling other than for speed of immigration.

Everything involves a queue, from parking, security, toilets, food, self service tills at WH Smiths and they have replaced all the seating with shops so you
are forced into the overpriced food outlets. Then one hour before your flight you see the Final Call sign flashing telling you to run to some gate half a mile away so you can queue some more. Priority Boarding on Ryanair is great value, if you particularly love spending time standing in dirty corrugated steel tunnels with a stranger's armpit for company. Getting back is even more fun, the queue on June 6th for a 7.30 arrival started at the bottom of the planes steps and ended about two hours later. Don't use the e-passport queue it takes twice the time. Bring a folding stool, a spare battery for your phone and maybe a copy of War and Peace to while away the time with no air conditioning, water, food or hope. Half of the passport facial recognition booths didn't seem to like working in the sun, which makes their placement testament to someone's total incompetence.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,T Higgins,NA,2007-03-30,Also in answer to Ali Dan Harry Albright is quite right about the best way to do it. The whole point is to avoid having to go through Swiss customs and immigration if you are staying in France. This is particularly true if you are coming from an EU country and remaining in the EU. There are baggage handlers on hand to fetch your baggage for you and it only takes a few minutes. In the meantime you are doing the paperwork for your car rental. I can guarantee that someone who went straight to the French side would have been in his car and on the road while Ali Dan was still going through French customs from the Swiss side. Going through Swiss customs and immigration is an unnecessary step. It's also quite easy to get landside if you find yourself airside. You don't have to ask anyone. Just go through immigration normally as if you were an arriving passenger out to arrivals and up to departures to check in.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,M Harrell,United States,2010-01-21,I went through the Frankfurt airport (FRA) on my way back to the US on January 18 2010 after new security procedures were in place and it took an average of 2 minutes per person in line to get through security. When I arrived at the security line about 6 or 7 people were in front of me and it took 15 minutes to get through. They now open and search every bag and I had a pat down search because I set off the alarm even though I had less metal on me than I have had at any airport before (glasses wedding ring and trouser clasp and zipper were all the metal I could think of). I originally had 1 hour 50 minutes scheduled between flights at Frankfurt but that was cut to 1 hour because of weather delays. I almost missed my flight and now I will try to never have less than 3 hours scheduled for Frankfurt. For those who have not connected through Frankfurt on their way to the U.S. you do not need to claim you checked bags in Frankfurt they just go onto the next plane. But you will need to go through security and a passport check on your way from a regional flight to the US. flight. You also are carried by shuttle from your regional plane (at least for some) to the terminal so everyone waits for the last person. That is another reason for why you would want more time for your connection than you would need at most larger US airports.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Using the transit lounge is probably twice as bad as getting your luggage from the carousel and re-entering through security as if you were coming into and exiting America.

There are no facilities inside only one toilet and no food and shops one check-in desk that open 2 hours before flight but the queue is reasonable.

houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,K Pruett,United States,2014-01-14,Flew through here last night from Mexico flight. The jam in Customs was spectacular. We waited in the cattle call lines for 1.5 hours. Approximately 800 ppl total. With 40 gates available only 2 open. The new kiosks were being used to check passports when you scan your passport you get a slip of paper (that should be the end of it) but no you then go into another line and wait for the 1 or 2 live people at the only 2 gates that hand stamp and initial your paper. Then onto another line for the customs person to again check your passport and initialled paper is taken. In the meantime some people are let to go right through after the kiosk and others going into another line. No rationale for that process. We had been allowed 1.5 hours between flights by United. Apparently you need at least 3 because by the time we took our bags out of the baggage area we could not recheck it because of time and took it with us through TSA. With all of that it took us almost 2 full hours to get through the process and that does not even count the time to get from terminal E to terminal C - a very long commute on a good day without people in the walk ways. As a result of the missing of the flight we had to spend the night in the airport hotel and miss the next morning because we then had to fly when we had not expected that. There needs to be a better system 40 gates and only 2 open. New kiosks that still require people to be seen by the 2 attendants at the gates and then the checkpoint beyond that just to make sure of what? The Customs system I understand is needed for our protection but really the expedition of the process should and needs to be streamlined and more accommodating for the flyers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Last week however I flew for the first time from T1. This was a much better experience spacious bright clean and not crowded at all! Queues at security differed enormously too. When we landed early and had to pass a few hours before getting a train T1 arrivals had plenty on offer. Flying out from T1 we were delayed due to bad weather but I found T1 departures a very pleasant environment to be stuck in!

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,N Fotheringill,NA,2004-06-10,Prestwick is my 'local' airport and I use it more than any other. The terminal building was built in the sixties and remained chronically underused for many years. Government interference stated that all of Scotland's transatlantic flights should land at Prestwick and not surprisingly few airlines took them up on the offer. This restriction was removed in the early nineties and it seemed as though Prestwick might be closed for ever. However with new owners touting for buisness Ryanair entered the scene and the airport has not looked back. Plenty of money has been spent in making the airport a viable alternative to the much more handily placed Glasgow International. Firstly a rail station was built on site giving passengers two trains to central Glasgow per hour. Car parks were expanded whilst internally a number of changes were made. Overall though the terminal is showing its age and such things as check-in have a distinctly low-tech feel to them. However the staff are courteous and the queues move quickly. Groundside catering has improved lately though the grandly named 'Graceland' bar (Prestwick is the only place in Britain where Elvis Presley is known to have set foot) has gone. Airside is an odd experience. You a channeled through the duty free shop (everything except booze and tobacco available to all passengers) to the waiting area which is below the level of the aircraft stands. It can get a bit crowded in here and very messy if a number of flights are scheduled at the same time. As most flights are with Ryanair the rush for unreserved seating leads to long queues through the one door that leads to the aircraft gates. Ryanair are supposed to have a priority system for boarding but no one pays the slightest bit of notice to it. Once through the door you walk to the appropriate gate underground emerging up the stairs on the tarmac for a short walk to the aircraft. On your return another walk brings you to the bagage reclaim which can be either very quick indeed or annoyingly slow depending on your luck. The worst part of the experience is paying the car parking fees which are huge. Book in advance if you can or better still use the train. Overall though Prestwick is not a bad airport to use and access will be much better next year when the road to Glasgow is upgraded to motorway standard.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Klaus Wy,Germany,2015-05-31,"I use this airport every 2 weeks and have done for 2 years now. In the beginning I admired how they managed to handle such a volume of traffic in a relatively small space. But now IST airport is going downhill very fast as it cannot cope with the growth of Turkish Airlines. The terminals which were built to handle about 30 million passengers annually now have to deal with nearly 60 million people each year. Same goes for the just 2 runways. I can understand that the airport staff are becoming increasingly frustrated and at times rude. Airside: Once you have reached Istanbul airspace be prepared that it will take at least another 30 minutes until you land. 3 weeks ago it took almost an hour as the plane had to fly for a long time over the Black Sea until joining the 100 kilometres long queue of other planes on their way to the final approach. Once you have touched ground you are not there yet. Taxiing takes quite some time as taxiways are often blocked by other planes and in many cases you will be brought to the terminal by bus. Also regarding take-offs delays seem to increase. It happened 2 times last month that the plane I took was on waiting position 10 to reach the runway after a long wait until starting to taxi so another useless 45 minutes being spent on the tarmac. Terminals: The waiting time for immigration is never predictable and can be anything between 2 minutes or 2 hours. Emigration is a bit faster but it is always difficult to predict as well how long it will take you. Lately queues seem to have become longer in general. Security check is usually relatively quick. The international terminal is very crowded and the food options are quite costly compared to Turkish price levels but normal compared to the usual rip-off at airports. I used the domestic terminal only once. It looked quite run-down and it took 30 minutes until the luggage was delivered. Not a good one-time-impression. In both terminals the number of airbridges is by far not sufficient which means that you will be taken by bus to and from your plane in many cases. When the departure announcement shows gates 301 - 312 you will get the ""flair"" of a totally overcrowded coach station. Ground transportation: The metro to the city centre is quite cheap (215 TL with IstanbulKart - you can get it at the airport) and runs every 6 minutes (which is not enough though between 18h00 and 19h30). The Havatas buses to Taksim are a comfortable alternative but during rush hours it can take much longer to the city centre.",NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

T2 isn't too bad in Arrivals - reasonable queuing in Immigration bags on the belt in a timely manner and exit the terminal 45 mins after landing - not too bad.

I feel sorry for the people who have to work there. Short queue for paying departure tax (PHP550 - I thought they were doing away with this and rolling it into the ticket price - but maybe that's too hard for the Airport management to arrange?). Well organised Immigration and Security screening. With the construction work in the terminal all the seating has been removed in the Departure area after Security with dozens of people sitting on the floor - total nonsense. Where exactly do they expect customers to go before their gate opens? I paid 650PHP?

I usually try and avoid T1 and the construction work which has been going on for several months now is obviously very disruptive but one would have thought they would be pushing it through at best speed?

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2006-07-23,Split Airport on a Saturday in mid-summer is obviously a different experience than reported by your previous correspondent. It is simply overstretched by the sheer volume of flights. Arriving wasn't too bad though we did have to queue for several minutes to get out of the baggage reclaim into the arrivals hall. Departing was awful. We had to queue to get into the terminal building itself and then join any check- in queue once we were inside as the only airline which seems to have a separate designated check-in desk is Easyjet. For all the others it is a free-for-all. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the head of our particular queue then we had to fight our way back through the queue behind us and across the hall to access Security and Departures. Security itself was fairly swift and efficient but upstairs in the Departures lounge itself there was more congestion with queues for everything including the loos (it took our daughter 20 minutes at least to pay a visit!). We were lucky: we managed to find two seats for the three of us to share while we waited for our flight to be called. From what we could see the airport itself could be as congenial as your other correspondent suggested but it is not really equipped for Saturday summer schedules. (There seem to be far fewer flights in the week - we stayed on an island across from the airport - so I'd advise prospective visitors to try to avoid flying into or out of Split at the weekend).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

My flight from LAX (via Incheon) arrived about 11PM. Only 26 minutes passed between my plane reaching the T1 gate and me leaving the airport to get a taxi. In the middle of the week I used T2 to go to Bacolod for a few days. As far as time it was faster going thru lines than most airports that I have experienced in the U.S. My only major issue with T2 are the very hard metal seats. On departure I arrived at T1 four hours before my flight. It took me 1h 45m minutes from leaving my taxi to getting to the gate. However 45 of those minutes were spent waiting for Korean Air to open their ticket counter. The air conditioning at both T1 and T2 was functioning. Having to go through a minor security check if I wanted to leave the gate area to get something to eat or use the restroom and return was no issue.

ljubljana-airport,/airport-reviews/ljubljana-airport,Ljubljana Airport customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2011-01-17,I used LJU twice last week for arrival and departure. The airport is small as well as amount of flights and passenger volumes. So it easily gets crowded when two planes arrive one after another. In my case everything was ok. No wait at immigration somewhat longish wait for bags to arrive clean toilets shuttle buses were simple to find nice staff and ok cafes. On departure effective and polite security staff fast immigration no wait at check in. Nothing spectacular but just fine. Free wifi across the building is a huge plus!

cardiff-airport,/airport-reviews/cardiff-airport,Cardiff Airport customer review,Peter Hodson,NA,2009-10-13,Cardiff Airport has strengths and weaknesses. It is small so you can easily get from one area to another without too much difficulty. It has a pleasant Executive Lounge and a small range of shops. Retrieval of baggage is fairly painless and staff are fairly friendly. However the airport is still set in the 1960's and the major re-construction work to make it a 2000's generation airport has not taken place. The limited choice of flights the supporting services of bars restaurants and car park all create the impression of an airport with limited ambition and initiative. Earlier comments about drop off and pick up remain issues to a certain extent (the logic of having a security barrier at which you are simply waved through without any check seems a particularly useless feature).,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
yangon-airport,/airport-reviews/yangon-airport,Yangon Airport customer review,Hugo Duran,NA,2003-08-07,We flew to this airport from Bangkok. We were welcomed on the platform by friendly people and were ushered to a nondescript building and not to the glamorous terminal next to it. Later we heard that only the local government bobo’s had access to this site. We were guided into the standard arrival terminal and this one served for the customs to get the visa for entry. We were the first visiting group which got here under a new rule our visa instead at the embassy in Bangkok. Can you imagine a bare big place hardly any sitting facilities and toilets. We had to wait approximately about one hour before the next hurdle could be taken queuing-up in front of the passport control. Luckily our Burmese guide used some money in order get our luggage quick through without a check on valuables. We needed about 21/2 hours before we arrived “in the country”. The next encounter with this airport was a domestic flight to Mandalay for which we had to check-in very early in the morning. We arrived at the airport and it was still dark our driver dropped us outside the entrance gate and before we knew what was going on a lot of porters were fighting over our luggage. We were not allowed to carry our own stuff and had to follow the two guys which were chasing our suitcases through the crowd to the departure hall. Both porters stayed with us until after check and double-check all with printed-out passengers lists at the boarding counters. Finally they put our luggage on a transport lorry were tipped-of by us they gave us a big smile and vanished in the overcrowded place to pick-up a new load. We were ushered through customs why is a question because it was a domestic flight and arrived in a hardly lighted departure hall looking for a place to sit and wait for our plane to leave. We found a place but were chased away; we had to sit in the foreign lobby. This place was identical to the first one and was also crowded by a majority of locals. Both lounges were unkept dirty sitting facilities inadequate and the toilets as expected very unclean. Two weeks later at arrival from Heho on this airport we did encounter the same hectic. After leaving the plane we were waiting in the arrival hall for our luggage to appear but nothing came. The lorry with suitcases stayed outside and suddenly a guy stood in front of us and asked for our flight tickets. He told us that he needed them in order to be able to get our luggage of the lorry. He was double-checked by an officer that he had the right stuff and he brought us to our in advance chartered taxi which was parked outside the gate. This was heavy work two suitcases of approx 20 kg each and a weekender with this load he manoeuvred agile through the crowd. The last encounter with this airport was a few days later when we had to fly back to Bangkok. The same procedure with our luggage at arrival until the check-in counter here porters were not allowed to stay and had to get out the building. Than to our amazement at the international departure everything was electronic registered. We went through the customs very smoothly and arrived in the international departure lobby. There were 6 up to 7 small stores with the usual souvenirs and other expensive stuff. Further there was enough place to be seated but these were not well kept for Burmese standards relative clean the air-condition did not function well because it was sticky hot and the illumination level was rather low. Conclusion: This airport does not meet the international standards but it is quite an experience to have been there. We did mostly encounter friendly people and you have to be acquainted with the way of working and the hectic about the luggage. Apparently it is a play between the taxi drivers and the porters that they drop the passengers outside the gate so a next person can earn a living. We did encounter the same organisation at the domestic airport of Heho where we were dropped-off 500 meters insight of the main gate.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,NA,2010-01-03,Since I last visited Manila 2 years ago things have changed dramatically: there are now 4 terminals: Terminal 1 is for all International flights (except Philippine Airways although PAL code-share flights use Terminal 1); Terminal 2 is for Philippine Airlines only (South Wing for Domestic and North Wing for International); Terminal 3 is for all Cebu Pacific flights and Terminal 4 is the Domestic Terminal used by local domestic carriers. Because of this there is far less crowding and entry through Terminal 1 is now devoid of the heaving snaking lines of passengers standing in a non-airconditioned space which was the previous norm and is now a 5-minute wait (don't forget to find and fill in an Immigration form before you present yourself at the desk - the forms they give out on the aircraft before arrival are only for Customs and are not for Immigration) in an adequately airconditioned area. Baggage claim is still chaotic but this is true in most airports. In all airports in the Philippines your baggage stubs are matched against the baggage tags so don't throw them away. Transfer between terminals is now more organised: the shuttle mini-bus has more seats the locations of the shuttle stops are signed and the driver is helpful: the bus visits all 4 terminals although it still has to use the public roads to do so (these can be a little crowded at times). The great advantage at Terminal 1 now is that the airlines open their check-in desks very early so even if you turn up 3-4 hours before your scheduled departure you will have a working check-in crew. Facilities in Terminals 1 and 2 for eating shopping etc are now reasonable (once you are in the departure lounge) and the toilets are adequate in number and clean. What more could you ask? Security is still tight (shoes belts and watches off) but there are sufficient scanners so no snaking lines of irritable passengers worried about missing their flight.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

damascus-airport,/airport-reviews/damascus-airport,Damascus Airport customer review,T Waugh,NA,2005-12-03,"Damascus Airport was quite an experience! The duty free as others have said IS amazingly cheap and very well stocked. When I got to Immigration the fun began. The visa was fine but the officials I met had never seen a New Zealand Passport before! After a few phone calls to HQ in town they let me in with a lot of apologies. They were very friendly though. Once through there is an ATM to withdraw cash a currency conversion booth or two and a counter where you pay 600 syrian pounds for a taxi voucher then they see you into the taxi. Going out even more of an experience! 75 syrian pounds to get a baggage trolley and get in then someone takes off with the trolley 'to whisk you through further"" then it's baksheesh for another hundred pounds... not a lot of money just annoying. Passport check at front of check in hall. Check in were very friendly another passport check. Then you pay two hundred pounds departure tax then go for the third passport check... this is the proper passport check departure Syria. The toilets are holes in the ground and they stink. The only thing that really bugged me was being locked in a glass cage with a hundred or so other people for an hour and a half while we waited for the aeroplane to arrive.

The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway).

guangzhou-airport,/airport-reviews/guangzhou-airport,Guangzhou Airport customer review,Leonard Wilcox,United States,2010-03-19,We were transit from Bangkok to Hong Kong through Guangzhou. Be very aware when transiting in CAN! Upon approaching customs you inform the agent that you are transit passengers. He or she will not stamp your passport but then will take the passport and boarding pass for the continuing flight and give it to a man in uniform who stuffs it into his back pocket and orders you to stand in an area six feet from customs with the other transit folks. After gathering three or four passports this uniformed character runs off to an office. I observed this occurring for five or six additional passengers. Then after about twenty minutes a young lady in uniform returns with a stack of ten or twelve passports - you must follow her around and point our your passport with she finally gives back to you. The boarding pass has a bunch of new stamps on it and you are led through a gate (with this group of unrelated transit passengers) and through a new security point and back into the gate area. A very intimidating and sloppy process - would not recommend that anyone ever transit through CAN.

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,J B Legrand,United States,2012-07-26,Used both the international and (new) domestic terminal last month. Facilities-wise it is no worse than airports in most developing countries and I have seen worse airports in many so-called advanced countries. International arrival involved the shortest walk from the plane to immigration I have experienced in recent memory. The visa-on-arrival counter had no line so no waiting. Bags took a long time to arrive but no longer than in any US airport. Paid USD20 to pre-order a taxi from the booth outside customs and was thus spared from having to deal with the bustle outside we were escorted personally to our car. International departure was also relatively painless in spite of having to put up with hordes of pushy elbowing passengers heading home to China and Taiwan. The gate area was nice with clean toilets and good views of tropical landscaping. The best experience was in the new domestic terminal; the local Indonesian traveling public is very courteous and well-behaved and the terminal had excellent facilities including a great lounge where USD4 buys you an all-you-can-eat buffet with excellent choices.

When he spotted that both our children have microchipped passports he directed us to special (short) lines for these thereby bypassing the main wait. We were then further taken directly through the US citizens' line since there was no-one else there and processed by a very cheerful and pleasant officer. With all the bad stuff that one reads about the treatment of visitors at some US airports it's great to report that TPA manages courtesy and efficiency. I can't beat Nick Jones' time but 40 minutes from the full 777 arriving at the gate to our leaving the airport is still pretty impressive.

My flight was cheap (though I didn't chose it for that reason) so I expected some inconvenience. I will be avoiding Stansted whenever possible in the future - shame because it used to be a nice little airport. So what went wrong? Delays coming on to stand - that's the second time in a row that has happened to me at Stansted. Then 45 minutes to get through border control and their 16 new automatic gates break constantly - several were not working at all while others were taken in and out of service while we waited. By this time Stansted Express had finished operating for the day. No sign on the station to tell you this until after you get to the platform and have already bought your ticket - of course I should have checked in advance but I assumed that as this is an ""Express"" airport line with lots of flights coming in after 11pm you don't expect it to operate like a rural branch line. How this clock off time makes economic sense for the train operator I don't know. Tried for the bus - hundreds of people milling about in confusion and a huge queue. The only bright spot was the taxi service. They were efficient unruffled with excellent drivers and clean cars and while it was costly their price seemed about right but how many people can afford a taxi?

Beautiful big efficient airport that works well except for one fatal flaw: the security arrangement in the transit zone. I strongly encourage anyone thinking of flying a route that involves connecting in Delhi to avoid this airport altogether by finding another route. It is massively inefficient slow incompetent and aggravating. The worst airport security set-up I've experienced except for Heathrow Terminals 3 and 4 in London which come a close second. It is under-staffed poorly designed and the people working there are obviously poorly motivated have poor technical training no common sense and no understanding about how to treat passengers like human beings.

Reasonably well connected to all parts the airport though small in size scores big in efficiency. Arrival is relatively painless with a short walk taking you to a row of immigration counters. Staff at these desks are polite - unlike what you find in some other airports in the region. By the time you go through to luggage claim your bags are already there. One sticking point though is transport to the city - only taxis most of whom don't use their meters which sometimes leads to new comers being fleeced. Departure is a little bit more of a runaround. You clear check in and immigration easily enough and the duty free shopping is great for an airport its size. Business class lounges are all right but around midnight when a lot of the flights to Asia and Europe depart the place can get to be a bit of a crush. That said you don't get the feeling of being in a cattle market that you get in Doha and Muscat.

I happened to run into a friend there who was simply transiting through MIA from one international flight (from Barbados to MIA and then onto Mexico City). He too also had to go through Immigration and Customs even though he was not entering the USA at all. No wonder the queues are horrific - they include transit passengers! After finally making it through Immigration I was interrogated by a very rude woman at the door of Customs who subjected me to an interrogation about my occupation education and travel habits. She made it clear that she didn't believe me and sent me for a full search. After waiting while other unfortunates had their baggage scanned and searched I was then interviewed by another (polite) officer who clearly couldn't understand why she had sent me there and waved me on without a search.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,Ian Silva,United Kingdom,2015-04-23,"In my experience Stansted airport is without doubt the worst airport in London. Being a regular traveller having used this airport on several occasions in the past two years since Manchester Airports Group took over its ownership the quality of service and efficiency have deteriorated markedly. Understaffing particularly at security combined with high passenger volumes means the queues are lengthy snaking out into the check in area. This situation exists at all times of the day often with several hundred people waiting. I have spent nearly an hour just to get through security particularly at early morning when many flights depart. In addition the staff are rude and dismissive to passengers shouting at people and being disrespectful. After passing through security passengers are herded like cattle through a seemingly endless narrow winding path forced to pass shopping aisles on either side. This creates a bottleneck by slowing passengers down ensuring there is no option to speedily get to the gates. Manchester Airports Group seem hell bent on doing everything possible to increase revenues by cutting costs through understaffing and turning this airport into a shopping mall. If I want to go shopping in an airport it should be my choice. Why should I risk missing my flight because this company thinks an airport should feel like Oxford Street in the week before Christmas all year round. Once you have escaped this and boarded the plane you can look forward to your return to the UK arriving to massive delays at immigration. Also the electronic passport gates often are not fully operational and those that are open do not work properly. I would not be surprised if they use this ""opportunity"" to place shops there while people queue to leave. By comparison Gatwick airport is a model of efficiency. It is well organised with courteous staff even when busy. I have flown in and out of Gatwick over a dozen times this year alone with no delays or problems departing or arriving. Today my destination in Asturias Northern Spain has only one direct flight a day unfortunately from Stansted.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2010-10-10,Check-in very quick and painless as I had checked-in online. One great thing about Auckland is that because it has fewer international flights than most comparably sized cities elsewhere in the world there is not the major panic to get through Emigration and Security to make sure that you don't miss your flight. Result - a much smoother transition with staff who are generally smiling and friendly. As I live fairly close to the airport I don't normally bother eating there although prices don't appear too much worse than in the city (certainly not the eye-gouging 500-600% markup I saw in Russia). The only criticism I would make airside as I have before is that it's a very long walk to Gates 15 and 16 and that more than one short travelator would be welcomed by most. Returning was easy for me - although there were quite long queues at Immigration I was directed to the new SmartGate as I have an e-Passport. Through and done in under a minute - brilliant! Luggage was already waiting on the conveyor and I was through MAF screening and out in the concourse in just a few minutes.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

They were brilliant. Everyone was boarded so we set off early and arrived back in Leeds Bradford airport early. Great for us as we were sure of catching our train back to York. Then the captain announced that we couldn't get off the plane as there was only one bus to take us back to the terminal and the plane that landed before us were using it. We sat for 30 minutes when the bus eventually arrived we were crammed like sardines on to it. Baggage Hall was even worse. 2 carousels with 2 arrivals on each. One carousel was moving but ours wasn't. We waited and waited and people were getting panicked as the people giving them lifts taxi's etc that were waiting outside to pick them up were ringing on mobiles. They knew the plane had landed but no passenger were coming out of arrival. Eventually after 1 hour our carousel lit up and a big cheer went up. Not for long. A young lad who must have been bored accidentally kicked the emergency stop button. it took another 5 minutes for someone to reset it. We ended up missing our train and having to wait on a cold Leeds Station until 2.15 in the morning. Nightmare. Do all the airport staff leave early on an evening. Certainly seems that way.

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,T Hess,United States,2012-12-07,Terminal 1 is possibly the cleanest and most relaxing international airport I have ever had the pleasure to fly through. The Terminal is open and clean. Announcements are kept to a minimum in the Terminal which contributes to a nice relaxing experience. From deplaning it is a pleasant walk through some nice shopping areas to baggage claim and onward. Speaking of baggage claim the area is large and open which prevents much of the clustering and crowding you will find at other airports. Signage is adequate and there are numerous Information Kiosks should you have a question. Note airport hotels are not marked as well but a simple stop by the Information Kiosk will reveal easy to follow directions. Note: all of my arrivals were from Schegen Countries so I cannot attest to incoming the Customs experience. The range of food selection isn't spectacular but you should be able to find something. Locating the Terminal connection bus was not difficult. Locating the Train station was easy. Be aware that Terminal 2 is like an airport in a third world country and takes about 10 or so minutes to reach by shuttle bus. Departing from Terminal 1 is easy although I do not prefer the separation of Terminal areas because you are then limited to food/shopping choices once you pass through Customs. This is however fairly common so it shouldn't come as a surprise. Finding your check in gate is simple enough (check monitors) and the security screening was a moderate wait. It was a pleasure passing through this airport on a few occasions recently.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

There is an excellent observation deck on the second floor with a good selection of restaurants and shopping outlets. The first floor is departures and the ground floor is arrivals.

Be prepared to take off belt shoes wallet etc. Check-in machines strategically placed and few queues (although my departing flight was at 3.30 am maybe the situation is different during the day) - I arrived at lunch time though and no problems either. Excellent connections into Boa Viagem and downtown via bus 042 (Aeroporto Opcional) passes in front of airport very frequent (daytime only).

The staff were disinterested in the fact you have a connecting flight, most of then can hardly speak English, so why are they there in the first place? The immigration officers are slow and there is not enough of them. We had to collect our baggage and then get through security even though we had a connecting flight. On the way back from Orlando we had a 2 hr 11 min flight and then a 3 hour wait to the flight back to Belfast, all with United Airlines. When we touched down (on time), there was no gate for our plane to go to, and then when we got a gate there was a plane at it, then when it left the pilot could not taxi to the gate, but had to be towed, but there was no one to tow the plane, then when we got to the get there was no one to attach the ramp to the plane.

papeete-airport,/airport-reviews/papeete-airport,Papeete Airport customer review,C Meyers,NA,2004-03-09,Papeete airport is a small airport and fairly straight forward. Arrival and immigration can be frustrating for anyone holding a passport other than a FP France or other EU country. The immigration line is divided into two lines: one for FP nationals France and EU countries. The other for USA Canada and others. We disembarked off an Air France 747 that was full (over 300 pax). My wife and I were the only Canadians on board with about 50 US citizens. Although there were over 250 pax in the FP France line they were processed much faster than the 52 pax in the other line. It was frustrating to watch a line 5 times larger go through faster. But that is the way they do things so we must respect the rules. Once through immigration it is to the baggage carousel. There is only one carousel and is fairly large so there is enough room for everyone to find a place to stand and wait for their bags. After collecting your bags there is a customs check. Agents have drug dogs sniffing and will randomly check bags. The process here was much shorter than at immigration. After you pass through customs you will be met by your tour operator. These people operate very efficiently and will get you on your way without much hassle. I had a connecting flight to Moorea. The Air Moorea terminal is housed in the building next to the main terminal. I could have walked there faster than waiting for the tour operator to drive us there. Oh well! The Check in area is small. Passports are checked when you first enter the terminal. Your baggage is screened through x-ray then you must get into line to check your bags with the airline. This process is not very efficient especially if there is more than one flight checking in. Security screening is efficient and the departure area has duty-free shops. The furniture is very comfortable and the gate areas do not seem that crowded. Overall not a bad airport. My biggest complaint is the immigration procedures for Non- EU pax and the procedure for check-in.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,S Brown,United Kingdom,2013-06-11,Having arrived from London we were treated to chaos in the customs area. Having been in London for 3 years I was shocked but the lack of forethought that had gone into the redesign of the area. Signs did not give accurate indications of where to stand particularly when there were crowds doors opens into queues the microchip scanning only works 50 percent of the time and seemed to have been designed by someone who assumed only 4 or 5 people would be using the service at one time. Staff couldn't care less that the scanning area was ineffective and that people were wandering around looking for assistance when the automatic machine wouldn't allow them to pass through. After queuing for the auto machines I was told the queue for assistance I then had to join wouldn't take long. Having seen the people in the standard queue who exited the plane with me leave the customs area I then had to stay for another 15 minutes. When I got to the front of the queue there was no apology or explanation for the delay or malfunction of the equipment in fact the woman was chatting to the other woman next to her about her weekend. Se was rude and when I didn't utter a word when my passport was handed back she commented to her friend that I wasn't very happy in a sarcastic tone. Out in the baggage collection the same issue with snaking queues and lack of movement was evident. The entire design seemed to be based on creating collisions with no forethought to the fact that people had to push huge trolleys throw queues of people with huge trolleys. Unsurprisingly the woman directing us to aisles for baggage checks was equally obnoxious.

Flights do leave in the middle of the night (because the middle of the day is unbearably warm) and they do leave late so patience (and flexible travel schedule) is a must. Bureaucracy is still in full effect with multiple X-rays and searches. Courtesy is in rare supply. And yes Sudanese do not queue for anything. You just shove and elbow and get to the front of the crowd any way you can. Even for no reason... the mob getting in the front door resembled a rugby scrum but once inside there were no big crowds and thus no reason to push and shove rather than just wait in line - it's just the way they've always done it.

I was hoping that things should have been improved a little bit over the past few years but I was disappointed to notice that nothing much has changed. Even we are in the 21century and every time I landed ISB airport I feel like I have travel back in time. Keeping in mind that ISB is the capital one would expect a better standard of facilities and services. This is the main contact point for the country with the outside world and the airport does not give a pretty picture for someone visiting the city airport for the first time. The airport building itself is so small that it cannot handle more than two or three flights at a time. I landed ISB airport late night. There were already few other commercial flights on the ground so I expected a rush inside the building. The minute we touch down the runway almost everyone switched on their mobile phones even the steward request clearly not to switch on the phones until plane is topped. As a result the whole cabin sounds like a mobile shop and customers testing their new toys. Eventually the plane stopped and we were taken to the terminal building in a bus. The bus drop you right outside the immigration lounge and everyone just run toward the door. I believe the main reason is that public knows how long it would take them should they decide to let everyone go first and that is the mistake I made. I was last in the immigration queue. Immigration officers have started taking USA style pictures at the counters before they stamp your passport and let you go into the next hurdle. I joined the existing queue and it took almost an hour before I could reach the immigration counter. Then everyone just rush to collect their luggage. There are not more than four luggage conveyer belts in total but only two were operational at that time. I managed to collect the baggage after half an hour and then it needs to be scanned again by the customs. It does not matter whatever the size of your luggage or suitcase they ask everyone to put their luggage on the scan belt. There seems to be no rules or regulations to follow and no one seemed to be interested to differentiating between passengers with just one hand luggage and a passenger with five suitcases. It seems that the immigration officer are not capable to judge that it is rather impossible to carry a TV stereo or any similar electronic item in a small bag. Eventually I came out and faced by people who wanted to carry my luggage including porters in uniform as well as taxi drivers acting as porters. One of them even pushed my bags without even asking me and expecting me that I would follow him to his taxi. Upon return to the airport same people try to push my bags and force fully tries to take luggage to the airport terminal. They will not even ask you to where I am flying? They just push luggage and expect me to take the lead once in the airport building. Passing through the security was simple but then I was welcomed (or should I say challenged) by the customs. The custom officer wanted to see inside my luggage without even asking me any questions. Once I pass though that then my luggage was put through the scanner and again another custom officer asked me to open my luggage again. If only I knew what they were looking for I could have told them. Then I get in the check-in queue. The facilities were not up to international standard at all as one would expect adequate level of service at an international check in desk. The whole set up is of poor quality as well as the building and surroundings are old and not very well maintained. Toilet facilities are not clean and up to international standards. People including staff shouting at each other across the terminal building. Most of the signs are in English keeping in mind that some of the passengers might not be able to read English. As a result passengers asking each other to which check in desk to approach and queue? Eventually I checked in my luggage and was sent upstairs in the lounge after passing through the immigration. Duty free is non-existent as compared to other international airports. The shops are of old style and looks like small stalls stuffed with local ornaments due to the size of the shop. The goods are over priced as compared to outside in the market. In essence there is no concept of duty free. There are waiters roaming on the floor asking passengers for tea coffee or sandwiches etc. I do not even get to see where the restaurant is? So cannot tell who is cooking what? And whether anyone is monitoring any standard of cleanliness in the cooking area? All in all it was an experience that I will remember for a while. Islamabad desperately needs another airport of international standard as the current airport was mainly designed to handle a small number of passengers with domestic flights. The airport itself gives a poor impression to any new passengers arriving to the Capital city. I heard that the Civil Aviation Authority are planning to construct a new airport building though I have also heard that works is yet to start!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However a long queue was encountered at customs which resulted in a half an hour 'crawl' to the customs officer. Customs officer was polite and at this time every customs station was manned. Another 20 minute wait to pass through security. It appears that queues form in the morning (as I encountered) but afternoons are quite relaxed as shown when arriving at 4.30PM.

United's Terminal has NO information boards to tell you which terminal and which gate your flight is due to depart at staff are rude and unhelpful when you are stranded and where on earth are the information desks?

Staff at immigration are efficient and friendly and no need to ""bribe"" like you have to in Vietnam and Cambodia.

Make sure you are checked in online and/or are a gold card or above member of the airlines you choose to fly often they have a special line open for that and staffs check and make sure you are qualified to queue up in there may save a lot of time.

durhamtees-valley-airport,/airport-reviews/durhamtees-valley-airport,Durham/tees Valley Airport customer review,Leo Enticknap,NA,2010-06-28,I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive; especially given that the volcano disruption would have meant fewer departing passengers and thus my car was not taking up a space that someone else would have wanted and been willing to pay for.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Access food service and ambience have been improving. However in the past six months it has declined significantly. In particular the recent switch to a single company providing all the food services has resulted in a decline in quality and an exorbitant increase in price of food. I am sitting in the Food Court in Terminal C. I just purchased a ""Bovine & Swine"" hamburger an Onion Ring and 1 fresh orange juice for $19.21 from ""Make Your Own Hamburger"". MacDonald's provided hamburgers at half the cost of this place. There use to be a Balducci's which made superb New York sandwiches. Now there are places that are more expensive and less good.

I found security queues short staff polite the whole departure area bright clean with a reasonable amount of seating. When called to the gate the ability to walk to the gate rather than being bussed was a much better experience than previous years. There was plenty of retail opportunities and I didn't find the prices that expensive compared with other airports. Car Parking we parked in premier only 2-3 mins walk from the terminal and again prices no more than other airports. Returning 3 days later the experience again was very pleasant from first arrival to picking up the car. The only thing which puzzled me was having to wait in the cold wet environment as our aircraft parked right in front of the main terminal to allow buses to move along the roadway between the aircraft parking bay and the building. We are the ones getting wet the people in the bus if there were any were in the dry? Why not allow us priority over those buses.

Immigration and security a joke half the counters are open even when the lines cross the entire airport - twice. If you're taking heavy carryons bear in mind there's stairs and the escalators might be shut for maintenance (there's no elevator). I remember once that my flight changed gates and the screens still showed up the old one so had to drag my bags all over the place to find it. The screens at the new gate were off and the airline personnel were chatting behind a glass door: not speaking the language I could only hope I was at the right place. The whole place was dark and dingy even smelled bad. There's cigarette butts and smell in the bathrooms.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,David Johnson,NA,2004-11-23,Kansas City International is an example of an airport that has the passenger in mind. This airport is the easiest to navigate out of any major airport in the country. With the recent renovations now done passengers will be greeted to a more friendly atmosphere and amenities that we have come to expect. The airport has virtually no wait times at security checkpoints and the drive to the gate feature is still truly remarkable. You can be dropped at the curb and be about 30 feet from your gate area. This is something that other airports fail to do. The biggest downside (to many) is the lack of amenities beyond security checkpoints. In most gate holding areas there are no restaurants gift shops and restrooms. To use any of these you must exit the sterile area and go through security once again after visiting them. This makes most passengers connecting at this airport angry. However the city has announced that restrooms will be built in the gate holding areas apparently this is the biggest complaint they have seen in recent years. To tell the truth I prefer the gift shops and restaurants outside the sterile area. Those living in KC have come to expect the lowest airfares in the nation. To have these inside the gate areas would create the opportunity for a airline to create a hub here and drive prices northward. This is why this airport is truly remarkable. It continues to attempt to discourage hubs and drive prices down with low-fare airlines offerings. Kansas City 's mix currently suits its passengers tremendously and one that should be quickly adopted at other major airports.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There was no meaningful communication. The cause appears to be the lack of adequate space in the Passport Control waiting area on the Ground Floor. Basically Stansted Airport is not 'fit for purpose' i.e. it cannot cope with the volume of passengers arriving at peak times. They can blame the Border Agency's procedures if they wish but the basic truth is they are trying to accommodate more flights than their infrastructure can cope with. The other passengers I spoke with were all of the same opinion which was that they would now avoid using Ryanair/Stansted wherever possible.

Remember Denver airport is 30 miles east and an expensive toll road from many points in Denver. Also traffic is very congested in Denver but only moderately so in Colorado Springs.

Transferring there twice in the past ten days at the peak mid evening period there were long lines for a seat until about 8.30pm.

International arrival. Walking distance from plane to passport control was ok the line for passport control was average but each desk has its own line. About 90% of desks were being used. In one case people had not filled out landing cards and were allowed to fill them in at the desk holding up that line. Baggage had started arriving by the time I had cleared passport control. Domestic (BKK-CNX one way) (BKK- USM-BKK) check in desks close to domestic security control no queues for my airline short line for security longer walk than expected to gates but good selection of shops and food outlets. International departure. Arrived early for my flight so was there for opening of check-in so it was very quick.

Connecting from domestic AA flight to International terminal (and vice versa) requires you to get outside and walk. It is not a long walk but can be confusing to folks who is not familiar with LAX.

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Miller,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,I had the misfortune to fly home from Chennai airport just under two weeks ago. It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too. This was on top of the body searches of course (which I know are necessary but do add more time to the process). This is without question the most inefficient airport I've ever used and I shall do my best never to have to use it again.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

It was very disorganized with long lines and lots of waiting. I had 4 hours between flights and I barely made the connecting flight. I came off an international flight and then waited almost an hour in line just to have my passport checked. Then it took 2 hours to pick up my baggage and recheck it. The line was incredibly long. When one man asked the personnel if he could go ahead of the others because his flight was in 15 minutes the lady told him she didn't care but he'd have to ask the other passengers. Of course that led to chaos as he tried to manuever his way through the entire line asking permission from every person. And when other people saw that they wanted to do that too. And then the other passengers started getting irritated and wouldn't let anybody in front (and rightly so). The only part that wasn't chaos was agricultural customs and that's because there were about 3 people including me in this line. I would only fly through here again if i absolutely had to. The staff was ok no one was outright rude but there were too many irritated people and not enough space and no it wasn't Christmas or any other high-traffic season.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It is apparently up to the airline you will board how long they will take to notice you. Two three hour waits are normal in a lounge bereft of anything in the way of amenities except for a vending machine. I would have lodged a formal complaint only the complaint box had no forms and no one would bring me some. A hint to cope with this situation if you have an Indian visa go out through immigration and come back through the check in counter. It will save you hours.

Overall I'm very happy with the efficiency of this airport especially in low-season. Last time I retrieved my luggage within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Those 20 minutes were partly spent by travel to the luggage reclaim (about 10-15 minutes in total) and a bit of waiting time. My departure was okay. The only thing I missed was a dedicated baggage drop-off counter for people who checked in online. Security is tight without becoming ridiculous and the air-side is diverse despite its size. There is a big duty free shop for alcohol smokes and perfumes. Other smaller shops scattered over the departure area cater to the needs of people looking for books/magazines jewellery clothes and more. There are also two cafe/bistros and a Hard Rock Cafe with shop. Prices are what you expect of an airport (more expensive than outside) but not ridiculous.

Bus tickets strictly cannot be purchased on board ! If a ticket vending machine is broken down (as in my case) one has to find another source for buying a ticket (a kiosk or go to the next bus stop). I was unable to find a kiosk selling bus tickets at the airport (but not all kiosks were open - so there might be one). To make things more complicated the ticket vending machines accept only coins (bring a lot of coins to purchase a daypass !). If more than one flight is leaving at the same time waiting times at outbound immigration and subsequent security check can be long.

Smallish departure lounge has old and faded carpet and seats. A central bar is available along with a few other eateries and shops scattered about the perimeter of the seating area. Can be crowded when an Air Pacific widebody is departing but even then a seat can be found. Getting online is a bit convoluted as you must first purchase a voucher at one website and then go to another site to exchange purchased voucher for a set amount of online time but once online speed is reasonably fast. Immigration and customs was quick and professional. A small irritant is that rental car return is to the offices in the arrival area which then requires a bit of a walk outside over to the departures end of the airport. Check-in Security and outbound immigration are straight-forward and painless (Make sure to keep your departure tab from your arrival card which is collected on departure).,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,M Payne,United Kingdom,2012-08-05,I flew from IOM to TLS transiting through LGW South Terminal. Flight arrived on time - long wait for baggage to come through but I wasn't in a hurry and there was plenty of seating available (8am). Tried to check in for onward Easyjet flight but was told I was too early and to come back in 2 hours as 'there was nowhere for my bag to go'! Tried to find somewhere to sit - I must obviously have looked lost and fed up as every available space was taken because a member of staff on their way home asked if they could help. Very relieved when she pointed to seating upstairs outside security. Not especially clean but adequate and I had a book to while away the time. Once checked in security was a revelation - an area to pre-sort liquids and get them into (free) plastic bags then straight through with minimal waiting time. There are now monitors to tell you how long each queue is likely to take. Once through here it's downstairs to a walk-through tax free retail experience is large enough to keep passengers occupied. You emerge into the central zone where shops and food outlets surround you on all sides. There are now lots of comfortable recliner style seats and when I was there plenty were available even though the area was very busy. There is still a lot of building work going on but you know that when it's finished it will look good and aside from a long walk to the loos which were not particularly clean but were busy the overall impression was good. For those passengers requiring assistance there is a dedicated 'zone' where they can sit in relative peace with staff in attendance and monitors easily visible. Staff were helpful and courteous. Given that the Olympics are in full flow I thought that LGW coped with everything extremely well. I have to admit I was much more impressed than I thought I would be.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

On arrival we were told to follow the sign's for connections too the E gates as we were in transit our bags were transferred to our next flight. On getting to the E gate we were met by two customs men who didn't look happy to see us. One of them told us not asked give me your passport boarding cards and customs entry form which we did. He then told us that he wanted to give us a bag check we gave him our hand luggage but it was our cases he wanted. We told him we were in transit and the bags were transferred to our next flight. He told us he would have them taken off the plane. He then directed us to Immigration to go through the security procedures. We did as he wanted us to do and were herded like cattle until we got to the next officer. He was just as unpleasant as the other. He then told us to go to the Baggage Reclaim after he had checked and stamped our passports we told him we were in transit this made no difference to his attitude. We went to the holding area where officers were checking other people's luggage and were told to wait. Our next flight was leaving in 25mins. A lady officer came to us and wanted our luggage receipt labels and boarding cards. After checking them she told us to wait. After five mins she came back and told us we could go catch our flight she told us our bags would be put back on the plane they didn't even check them.

Though the old names remain Term 1 and 3. Reasonable shuttle between Terms. But indeed depending on arrival gate you can have a long walk (some moving sidewalks) - benefit being most times your bags are on the carousel when you get there. Food is good. Go to Tim Hortons if only a coffee donut soup or sandwich will suffice. Prices are close to outside the airport. Lots of hotels adjacent to airport. Bus service taxi and Limo to get downtime. This is the weak link- no train subway nor LRT- (express service) - solution keeps being a govt promises. There is now a cell phone lot. Customs hall is large - and signage (ie 'EXIT') could improve significantly. Drug/Contraband dogs are used - particularly for flights from Jamaica .

We had almost 5 hrs transit time so was very relaxed. Luckily both the incoming and outgoing flights were on time. I guess it will be tight if you have a transit time of anything around 1hr since there might be long queue at security controls and the long walk between Terminal D to F. We had to first go to the transit desk and then they guide you to passport control (transit without visa) and then proceed for security. The signs at the terminal are easy to follow and you don't have to ask anyone. Terminals D and E seems to be new and very well maintained. There are lines of duty free shops through the transit. The bad part is that the air conditioner only works in terminal D and E. You go down the stairs to terminal F and the whole terminal has no ac and it was very hot. Terminal F looks like a shopping mall and extremely crowded. So we spent our time in terminal E. Many shops there don't accept Euro / $$ or the exchange rate is extremely unfavourable. We spotted automated teller machines that converted Euro or $$ to Roubles & it had a more favourable exchange rate. The food and drinks here is actually overpriced. Luckily we did get vegetarian options at a food joint close to Gate 50 in Terminal F. Overall was a good experience.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Be aware that there's not much in Terminal E and no Swiss Lounge - except for time for clearing the pointless duplicate security for US travel don't go out there earlier than you have to.

I experienced delays in both my inbound and outbound flights so I got to see a lot of the airport. Immigration is a major hold up since they are very thorough at checking and have few staff. I went through the gates 6 times and each time spent over an hour in the queue. The departure lounge is small. but with plenty of seating and an excellent view of the apron and runways from the observation balcony upstairs. There are a few shops and a money exchange kiosk that changes money at the exact rate ie. it doesn't charge commission. There are two bars serving food and drink but this being Cuba the food selection is limited. I was there for 3 days and all they had was cheese and ham rolls for the entire time. Overall it's a pleasant enough place for normal transfers but you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time there.

Typical Greek Airport - lots of flights on the same day (and probably all crammed into the same hour). There are now two luggage belts but the TV screens telling you which belt is for your flight are almost unreadable as you have to look directly into the sun to see them. Chaos reigns when you come to depart - queuing outside in the sun for an hour or so absolutely rammed through security into the departure lounge as all the flights now depart at or about the same time! This was an early June Monday morning - nowhere near the peak season - and the airport isn't really fit for purpose. Facilities once through security are minimal and there are just not enough seating areas.

The facilities in T5 are good with several restaurants and a reasonably priced Wetherspoons bar (albeit the bar has a limited seating area for those purchasing drinks and not food). Its a bit bizarre that the smaller Wetherspoons bar in T5b has 4 times the seating. The free wifi is very slow and intermittent worked much better on outward than inward journey. The outbound transit was very quick and efficient. However offsetting this was the usual amount of time to exit/enter Heathrow on the plane - outbound delayed 50 minutes inbound by 30 minutes. Arriving at T5 transfers on 25 May was a disgrace - 1 officer having to deal with fasttrack EU and non EU nationals. No movement at all for 15 minutes. Staff co-ordinator realised eventually situation should be being resolved and eventually 2 more officials came out to assist. My non EU partner was held up briefly as well when eventually seen but issue then resolved swiftly.

Parking was close enough to the terminal to walk and was incredibly cheap. Check-in was no different from any other airport I have ever used and security is no worse either (always a trial anywhere). Prices at the bar and cafe were shocking (more expensive than Heathrow) but you don't have to buy. On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it. It's a shame that there are not more flights but this might cause its own problems with congestion.

We also found the lack of comfort and facilities once we had been through departure gates and security very disappointing. Specifically disabled people who turn up on time for a two hour check-in really do not appreciate having to stand for nearly an hour before being able to check in with no opportunity available to sit down. Even once we had checked in we were unable to go directly to the departure lounge because another flight had to be cleared out first. Then when we got to the departure lounge we were disconcerted to find that there was no direct access to airline lounges ( we were travelling business class) where we could have relaxed.

With 400 or so people waiting this is very tiring and time consuming after a long flight. I understand that safety and security are vital but a few more staff present might have speeded up events at immigration.

I was on the road barely 10 minutes after landing on my return (hand baggage only) but had some trouble checking in at Brussels where the staff still referred to the airport as Teesside then again passing through passport control at Heathrow when I gave Teesside as my destination and was told somewhat sharply (and lacking any humour in tone or body language) by the man on the desk that there was no such place! Seriously road signs must be a real pain for strangers to the area - why on earth can't quick stick-on amendments have been made by now?

Surely the airport authorities should try to offset this by ensuring all security terminals were open to allow a much quicker flow of passengers.

hanoi-airport,/airport-reviews/hanoi-airport,Hanoi Airport customer review,J Scott,Vietnam,2013-02-19,Horrific experience during Tet. It seems that the airport management did not make any attempt to deal with the extra amount of visitors during this busy season. Domestic departures are a joke. They run 3 security gates but for the economy class passengers there they only open 2 the third is reserved for business class and 'priority' passengers. As a result the queues are so big that there is no way that the departures hall can cope - especially with no effort to organise a queue instead allowing passengers into a free-for-all scrum. Given that possibly 10% of passengers are business class or 'priority' this flaw in security gate allocations mean that 90& of passengers are squeezed into only 66% of the gates. If there was the slightest bit of common sense among the security staff then they would filter economy class passengers through the business/priority gate to ease the strain on the overly-busy economy gates. It makes no sense for a third of the security gates (and therefore a third of the security staff) to stand there doing nothing whilst the other two gates are bursting at the seams. Even when passengers who were rushing for their flights were allowed through they were forced to jump the queue of the gate relevant to their ticket therefore skipping the economy class queue. I would suggest a through review of security procedures especially considering the staff were more confused by my Vietnamese residence card (which is helpfully translated into Vietnamese) than my English passport - something I would have hoped to speed up the process! The departures hall is bearable with just about enough seats. Thankfully the domestic terminal is moderately priced for food and drink if you are a foreign/expat traveller but I suspect on the expensive side for local travellers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The arrival exit leads out to a fenced-in area which cuts off the concourse into two halves. The Departure roadway also doubles up illegally as a pickup area and as a result cars are double parked buses coaches and taxis of all kinds obstruct the roadway and the end result is absolute chaos. Touts are plentiful. I have had the misfortune of spending 1.5 hours waiting for a phantom shuttle vehicle from the hotel.

It's the epitome of incompetence and poor customer service with Terminal 2 being the worst of the 3 terminals. Poor layout e.g. Terminal 2B with sealed departure lounges and no toilets. Confusing signage with unnecessary profusion of letters and numbers for sub-terminals check-in desk clusters etc. Lots of staff checking boarding passes and telling passengers where to queue but too few staff actually doing work to process passengers and reduce queue length e.g. often just one or two officers on Passport Control with hundreds of passengers waiting. On one occasion the queuing time at Passport Control was so long that a couple of people fainted. Inaccurate out of date flight information e.g. flights shown as being on time when the time is long passed. Limited food outlets given the volume of passengers but plenty of upmarket shops with unaffordable prices. Strikes by baggage handlers and even by the drivers who operate the runway buses. Overall CDG gives the impression of being run for the benefit of its employees rather than the passengers who pay their wages.

As these 'peripheral' airports go it isn't that bad. On arrival the bags arrive fairly quickly and it was a short walk to the bus. These run frequently and apparently wait for the incoming flights which is important of you are scheduled to arrive late. Three buses an hour leave Stockholm's central bus station for the journey back to Skavsta. Returning to the airport check-in is a bit of a slap-dash affair. There are a number of check-in machines which print boarding passes and baggage tags for both Ryanair and Wizzair flights. However if you have luggage you have to join the bag drop queue which is just about as long as the conventional chaeck-in queue. Most of the machines were unservicable when we arrived anyway. There is catering both landside and airside. Remember that this is Sweden - prices are very steep. There is a small duty free shop and well that's about it really. There are five gates two of which require passing through passport control and are used by flights to the UK. There is nothing the other side apart from a few chairs so you are probably better waiting to go to your gate for as long as you are comfortable in doing so.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Tom Watts,United Kingdom,2014-11-25,"It really is staggering how bad Bristol Airport is for a regional British airport. The problems start with actually getting to the place the bus is hugely expensive (£7 from the station compared to say £3.20 for the metro from the station to the Airport in Newcastle (which is a further distance but much faster) hugely impacted by traffic - there are no bus lanes on the route into the city and without alternative apart from taxis or private hire. If you drive to the airport then you better not follow the signs because you won't really get there well not in anything remotely resembling a reasonable time as the signing routes you out of the city then back into the centre again before directing you back out this is to avoid a residential area but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. Check-in/bag drop is usual for a regional airport not good but it works in the height of summer its a nightmare but otherwise its reasonably organised and as its quite a small area it works ok. Security is usually quite well organised but the staff are the worst I have ever experienced in the entire world. Its really tragic I usually make some kind of error even though I try really hard not to its like they're trying to catch you out the liquids rules are followed with an iron fist! I was once taken into a private room for having a ""hidden compartment"" in my bag this was actually just an interior pocket that the security person was unable to open I offered to help but was told to not interfere and then taken to a private room.... brilliant. I also walked through with a chap stick in my pocket which was found during a routine pat down apparently I was trying to ""smuggle liquids on board"" and the offending chap stick was placed through the x-ray. The departure area is hilarious firstly this is the only airport I've ever been to where the largest shop is a Claires Accessories. Not that it isn't an important thing to have in the airport but its not going to help get around the fact that there is no-where decent to buy a sandwich except starbucks which is tiny and often sold of most things by the evening. The seating isn't bad once you work out there's an upstairs but overall the whole place is poorly laid out and several of the gates queue straight into the main shopping area which while nicely avoiding a long walk does make the whole place disorganised. To compare Bristol to larger airports would be unfair but even compared to other similar regional airports is a disaster I've been to most airports in the UK and every time I'm in Bristol I'm always surprised that it is just as bad as I remember it being.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

No staff on arrival to assist with trolleys and suitcases. Other staff completely unhelpful saying that it's not their job to help!

Mind you yesterday (2/4/2008) the restaurant was closed and knowing that Bulgaria Air only provides a sandwich on its 2030 flight to London made things difficult as well as expensive (if it had been open). Coffee in central Sofia 1.5 to 2 lev. airport 4.5 lev. 50cl beer in Sofia downtown 2 lev small-town Bulgaria 1.2 lev. Airport 6 lev. Outrageous. Don't even ask about spirits. Gets even worse airside. So be prepared. There is a taxi prepayment if you arrive at the airport and want to go downtown but be prepared to haggle to go back to the airport from the City. Public transport not advertised and incredibly difficult to find out about. Under no circumstances take a taxi from the Central Rail or bus Station. Taxi driver will calm you by saying he will use the meter - but will flag a tariff 4-5 times the official rate. Sad but true.

The flight was on-time and the wait for my baggage was very reasonable. It was a facile airport to navigate and I was easily able to locate the person picking me up in the arrivals area. Upon departure that evening I flew to Sydney. We were late arriving as business kept us late. Hence I was in a rush. However I was dropped off and was able to check in very quickly.

Having read all of the reviews I can pretty much agree with all of the negative comments. The security staff are generally quite rude and always seem to be standing about not doing much. Even when the airport is quiet there still seems to be queues for security and if my bag goes down the separate channel for inspection it usually takes over 5 minutes before somebody comes over and takes the bag for a check. The departures lounge looks tired and even with the new restaurant and shops it is still not that great. One of the biggest benefits was the season ticket parking which was available. It was a good price and in my opinion value for money. No surprise then that this has now been stopped and I have to go through the tedious booking of car parking every week when I use the airport.

Tourism is a major earner for the state of Tasmania and brings in a lot of money so use some of it to upgrade this airport even further. A modern terminal building with aerobridges would be nice. We had to run to the plane during a heavy rain storm and its not pleasant sitting in a plane for a couple of hours feeling damp. The Qantas Club is pleasant but is tucked away in a little corner before security. Not the best place to locate it considering the Qantas Club makes boarding calls after the flight has commenced boarding.

A case in point was the security screening – I have some metal in my leg that occasionally triggers the metal detector and it happened while going through security at Tuscon. The TSA person that dealt with me went through the standard procedure for dealing with this sort of thing (this wasn’t the first time for me) but they also managed to be human about it in stark contrast to what I’ve encountered at some other airports where the TSA person I was dealing with might as well have been a robot. I would agree that the dining options at Tuscon aren’t the greatest but I was still able to get something satisfying to eat. We even had some entertainment courtesy of the Arizona Air National Guard (also at Tuscon airport) who were doing training flights in their F-16s and treated us to an impromptu airshow.

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Edmund Carew,NA,2008-06-16,Cebu is a more convenient and less hassled entry point to the Philippines than Manila. Taxi travel to and from Cebu's CBD is efficient aided by the two bridges in lieu of the former one connecting Mactan and Cebu islands. Provided one arrives on an airline like SilkAir that flies at off-peak times to Cebu immigration queues can be non-existent. However leaving can be a different story with a 20 minute queue to obtain entry to the checkin area and then a 25 minute wait in the mid afternoon through immigration. Cebu's beautiful resorts are popular with Koreans so make sure that the departure time of your flight does not coincide with flights to Seoul or Pusan - you will not be able to get to your gate in five minutes. The restricted entry to checkin is designed to stop hordes of well wishes from clogging checkin but it does add a delay not found in many other non- Filipino airports. There is a limited range of shops once through immigration and they do not stock basics like 'load' for a local cellphone - so come prepared with snacks if need be. It is possible once you have checked in to hand in your boarding pass and re-enter the 'outside world' but you do have to then queue to go through security to the checkin area so some may conclude it is not worth the hassle to bid a final goodbye to family friends or business associates.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Wait until you're on the plane to use the restroom. If you're just arriving you will be besieged by porters who will grab your bags without asking then hustle to the exit. Just say no with a smile and that should do the trick. The airport uses a taxi voucher system which will charge you a flat (tho grossly inflated) fee depending on your hotel.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,S Sowards,United States,2011-07-17,My experience at CDG was absolutely terrible. I was in Terminal 2 which belongs to Air France. The check-in lines were horrifically long. After you endured check-in you were faced with mayhem at security. The terminal had created three different security lines- one for first class one for Asian flights and one for flights to the US. Of course barely anyone went through the First Class line. Then there were only about 5 flights in the Asian line and about 3 working scanning machines. For the US line there were roughly 12 flights assigned to this line and only one working machine (which actually stopped working by the time I got to it). The line had no rhyme or reason- employees would open up sections of the line to let people into another seemingly faster line only to let them back into the original line when it wasn't actually faster. So I spent about 2.5hrs in that security line. When I got to the scanning machine there were no signs to inform you that every single electronic device had to be taken out of your bag so the machine would go off for every bag that passed through. The walk-through scanner didn't work either. My plane was delayed 1hr because it had to wait on all of the people who were stuck in that horrific security line. It was utterly ridiculous. Nightmarish. I am so discouraged from going back to Paris. Definitely won't be leaving from CDG again. Don't make the same mistake.

MU groundstaff at the transfer counter were courteous and helpful in assisting me. As were the customs staff when we had to pass security. Although washrooms were clearly marked and locations were adequate I didnt appreciate having to either go down stairs or take the lift to access them - nor the fact the smoking lounges were located next to them. The second time using Pudong I found taking the Maglev enjoyable although accessing the Station in Pudong is annoying having to take the subway first to LongYang.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Leonard Victor,United Kingdom,2014-06-08,"The worst airport in the UK and possibly Europe. Long queues forming almost everywhere. Further long queues for security. You are forced to walk through acres of rip off shops on your way to departure. Unspeakably ugly buildings and jetways look like industrial warehouses of the cheapest kind in their dull grey paint. Unless you are lucky to board from a carousel shaped departure point nearly all the departure gates require up to a 2 mile walk. It is quite possible to miss your flight even arriving 3 hours before due to the pathetic staffing levels at passport immigration and security. The toilets are badly serviced and constantly sub-standard. The restaurants and bars are a complete rip off. Arriving back is even worse especially if your airline uses the appalling Swissport ground handling. After one flight we waited nearly two hours in baggage reclaim. The new ""makeover"" has actually made Gatwick even more ugly as if that were possible. The whole infrastructure is chaotic depressing and ad hoc. Passenger lounges walkways and other areas are oppressive and over lit to the point of being headache-inducing. There is virtually no foliage or pleasant distractions from the unremittingly brutal design. Low ceilings and endless identical looking passages create confusion. The entire airport is an exercise in getting you to spend exorbitant sums on food water drinks or duty free while attention to comfort or efficiency is almost zero. The airline desks are manned with surly unhelpful and rude staff. Complaints are largely ignored. The habit of queue management in the form of endless sheep pens going back and forth means forward progress even on quiet days involves walking to and fro endlessly. Immigration and passport staff are by default rude contemptuous and look at even children as though they are criminals. This airport should be shut down and started again. It is the most depressing passenger-averse monstrosity it has ever been my experience to visit time and time again.

Last summer we travelled in July (kids school holidays) but previous to that it was always in June. Our experience last year was a complete nightmare. Like a previous post on this site the queues are everywhere and it creates panic with passengers afraid they will miss their flight. On arrival once we left our hired car we queued for the check-in desk - very long wait. Then once checked in we queued for the x-ray hand baggage check - very long wait. Then into the duty free lounge and we had to queue again for passport control. Terrified we would not make our flight. I can only assume the reason for this is peak time travel in July (as opposed to my previous years travelling in June) but now I see from other comments that this has happened on other months. I have to say it is the one thing that dampens my ideal holiday in Portugal - we are returning but I dread the thoughts of those long Queues.

We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written.

The restaurant is busy hot and noisy but good value with freshly cooked pizza and pasta available. Security was somewhat slow (20 mins.) and ignored an obvious queue jumper who appeared from nowhere dived under the queue barrier then presented himself ahead of others who had been waiting. This really should have been noticed as a security concern not just the queue jumping. The security screening seemed over-sensitive which slowed things down. There are few facilities once through security so it’s a bit of a gamble to leave it as late as possible. Leave going down to the gate until the flight is in. The gate area is inadequate particularly given that passengers were allowed through when a delay was expected. It would be impossible to imagine more than one of the four adjoining gates being used at a time as the waiting area was full with one. The seating is totally inadequate.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Steve England,United Kingdom,2012-11-22,Flew into MIA today from Las Vegas. I'd previously sworn never to use this airport again after a nightmare transfer a few years ago. However I wanted to see the city and thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I was actually leaving the airport rather than just transferring. More so as it was a domestic flight so no immigration. WRONG!! The airport is poorly signed it is an incredibly long hike to baggage reclaim and by the time I got to the correct belt the carousel had stopped. On asking what had happened to the remaining baggage including mine a rude young lady merely said that it would be on the adjoining belt. I told her that I'd checked and the signs did not indicate the arriving flight from Las Vegas she told me to go to the baggage service desk which I had to find by myself. The staff there said that I should just go to my hotel and they would deliver my missing suitcase there. Not trusting MIA staff to do this I said I'd wait at the desk until they found it which they did surprisingly quickly. Two other passengers on my flight were at the desk with the same problem. The airport is poorly laid out long long walks past the gates to baggage reclaim rude uncaring staff and generally a total dump. The differences between MIA and McCarran Airport (Las Vegas) are stark McCarran being a very pleasant experience in contrast. MIA is by a mile the worst airport I've been to (and I've been to scores around the world). If you want to visit Miami try flying into Fort Lauderdale (not far from Miami).

There's been talk of expansion and the little expansion that has happened is barely noticeable (more check-in counters at departure). Rude officials at arrivals and I have had my bag searched every time I have come through here.

As soon as I arrived I had the feeling that I arrived to a developing country. First I had to walk from the airplane to the airport under light rain. Waiting for the luggage was another joke as it took a hell of a long time and there was also this guy with a chalk marking all the luggage that were moving on the carpet (no idea why). Eventually I went to customs (I had nothing to declare) yet my luggage was searched 3 times. It was actually the first time that my luggage got searched in front of me let alone 3 times by 3 different people. I discovered later that the customs people were doing this in order to get money. Oh and all through the way there were staff asking for money. I specially remember that guy who asked me ""What did you get for your nice friends in Africa?"". Now when departing I was amazed to see that the gate looked exactly like my class when I was 11 or 12 I guess: crowded all people facing the same direction and no A/C.

The development is clearly unfinished and for some reason you are prevented from accessing the shops once you enter the domestic pier I have NO idea why this is as anyone arriving from this pier has cleared security at a UK airport and so can hardly be a security risk if they are connecting.

It's very easy to reach by public transport and by car (there were some rush hour queues when the infrastructure was being rebuilt but that's finished now) very difficult to find a parking space close to the terminal on busy days. Kiss and ride zone works very efficiently when Police are patrolling without Police it's chaos because people leave their car parked. In 90% of the times never had to wait more than 30 minutes for checking in (I don't bother checking in online or using the machines) Staff is usually very friendly and they know multiple languages. Security can be really bad on some days so expect long queues. Again in about 80% of the time got through in less than half an hour. Terminal A is modern very spacious and very nice to be in but about 15 minutes of walking from the check-in area. Terminal B is older but does not look aged less shops and less seating. Baggage drop off was very efficient my luggage would be waiting on the belt but that's changed after some worker strikes.

They use 2 strong men to transfer you to a special chair then strap you in before being carried down the steps. This is not very dignified (unless of course you enjoy being carried by strong men!).

Departure from ISB was the worst as we had a flight at 3:25am to DXB and just to get into the airport there is a heavy queue to go through security (that people just cut anyhow) then once you're inside you have to go through Narcotics Control - fortunately they didn't feel a need to bother me so I didn't have to wait for them to check my bags then they scan your bags and you go through a metal detector again then after you can finally go to the check-in desks.. the check-in area is just terrible dirty and extremely disorganized bag scales broke midway to checking in for the flight so then everyone was shouting and making a scene (mind you this is 2:00am) finally after 30 minutes they fixed it and checked all the bags in after that you go through passport control then security again. The best is when you go to the ""gate"" which is just a door leading outside with multiple flight queues at the door. No PA system was used some guy was just screaming flight numbers and we went out to the buses then when we get to the aircraft it's not ready so we had to wait on the bus for about 30 minutes a little kid passed out as it was so hot on the bus and the driver refused to open the door - all I can say is never again!",NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I arrived from Prague at about 23.30 and we were bussed to the arrivals area. I was quite amazed as the machines were working and I was able to clear customs in a few minutes. My sister picked me up – she still had to pay a pound for driving into the pick up / drop off area where I jumped into the car and we were away in two minutes. Return trip was not as enjoyable. I had bought some small items for my car and let the check in guy know that I wanted to go to the separate scanner just in case there were any problems. He misunderstood my English and proceeded to put a red “firearms” tag on my suitcase. I explained to the officer and once again he had real difficulty understanding me. So now the rush to the loading gate a complete nightmare I am not “disabled” but have great difficulty walking any more than 100 metres without being able to sit down and have a rest for a minute. The sign telling me that I had only 300+ metres to go didn't help at all and by the time I reached the top of those steep stairs down to the loading gate I was in agony.

Departure was where it turns ugly. Only two customs desk opened and airlines crew kept on jumping my queue to go through. I understand they can quickly get in by casually waving their passport/document to the custom officer but this should not be at the expense of the other passengers queuing patiently especially when there were more than twenty of them from different flights getting ahead of you. Departure food and shopping is quite nice and I thought I would overlook the customs issue by getting a good takeaway breakfast and eat at the gate waiting area how wrong! Security checking was at the gate (Terminal H) and there was a sign saying no restaurants beyond that point. So I had to throw away my bottle of orange juice purchased just minutes ago that I haven't even opened. I could have downed my drink before going through security but the queue was building up fast (I am actually among the first to turn up at the terminal area after gate info became available) so I tensed up and left the bottle behind at the mouth of the x-ray machine with the security officers. Immediately afterwards I felt so disgusted by this stupid security arrangement (I spent £2.5 for nothing!) I threw away my food in rage as well. (Yes I should have better EQ but you just don't expect this sort of treatment at a major international airport do you?). Once we reached the gate's waiting room we had to queue right away and there were just no seats.

This is not the worst one but the architecture is all show and nothing practical therefore efficiency is difficult to obtain. The new thing when you fly Air France in economy is that you do everything yourself : print your boarding card but also your luggage label that you have to fix yourself to your suitcase (do not forget to take off and keep the receipt). When you have queued to leave your suitcase you go through passport and luggage control which is not the worst but not the best either. Try to get a sandwich and you find that the famous architect has completely underestimated the necessary seating space in the 2 small underground snack bars as well as the restrooms which could be cleaner. Then go to boarding gate and go through the most incredible experience CDG has created so far : we went down the stairs to a bus that drove 5 to 10 minutes in the airport to leave us not at the plane but at another gate! Then we went up the stairs to board the plane that was accessible via a gateway but not at the proper gate.

On the face of it it appears clean and tidy but as you spend more time there it's seriously lacking. Firstly there's no where to change money or obtain visa advances. I arrived with £1000GBP of travellers cheques and had a 4 hour connection. I was unable to purchase any food or drink and the 1 restaurant that is there only accepts Syrian money. If you are lucky you can pay with euro pounds or dollars in hard cash. Otherwise you have to starve or die of first. There is a duty free shop that accepts visa and sells incredibly cheap cigarettes (I think they were $1USD a packet). However you won't be able to buy any food or drink to consume with your visa card unless you don't mind living off toblerone and whisky. Toilets didn't have any toilet paper in them. I was sitting on the seats and I left my girlfriend. When I returned she had moved because an older Syrian (I presume?) guy had started waving his stick at her and telling her to move. He had then requisitioned the whole seat and sat around 9 burkah wearing women on the seat opposite him.

The end product is a big disappointment for those of us who have been waiting for a new terminal for over several years. This is not an 'international' airport to feel proud about.

Arrival is painful: the immigration officers take about ten minutes for each Indian passengers (foreigners are faster but are few and far between) so unless you are among the first off the 'plane you will have a very long wait. Then you have to wait for checked baggage -- the screening procedure means that two hours can easily pass between touchdown and your bag arriving. Departures: note that once you have checked in you cannot leave the departure area and so are at the mercy of the limited and over-priced catering that the airport offers. Check-in was slow and inefficient with staff who couldn't be bothered to handle requests for exit row seats etc. There is a cyber-cafe in the departure lounge but its computers have loads of pop-ups and probably spyware as well so not a good place to do your on- line banking.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

This is check-in hell. There are no take-away food shops to buy something to take onto a flight either before security or after only expensive restaurants - and who has the time to sit down for a meal when rushing to a plane because it took over an hour to clear security?

san-francisco-airport,/airport-reviews/san-francisco-airport,San Francisco Airport customer review,T May,United States,2012-01-28,Unlike most big airports in America such as LAX O'Hare Dulles Logan Reagan or from what I've heard JFK this airport is not a nightmare to navigate. The signage is plentiful which is a great help when locating the otherwise hidden baggage claim. The terminals (especially the new one that houses Virgin America and the International one) are very nice though the restaurants are fairly pricey. The staff are helpful but a little no- nonsense which can be irritating. Commuting is a breeze thanks to being located right off the highway and the metro. Customs is done without hassle. On the downside the process of checking in and getting through security can be abysmal at the wrong time the majority of flights are United and flights are often slightly delayed because of fog. Because of this I prefer using the smaller airport in Oakland across the bay when I can. Regardless this airport is what all big airports should be.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

What might have also influenced my feelings was the fact that I had spent a month in the Middle East where I met staring eyes because of red hair and very fair skin; thus stopping at Shannon was a total contrast where I could pass as native quite well. Oh and I met a man named Brian O'Brian wearing green. After that stereotypical experience I expected lucky charms in my beer! Alas there was a nice coffee bar emphasis on bar.

Queuing at immigration took 2 minutes and my luggage was on the carpet when I reached it. This my fastest arrival experience at a major international airport. When departing from Incheon however realizing I had forgotten to return a key to my hosts as I was about to go through the hand luggage check. Since there is no post office nor mail box where I could send the key past the luggage check I wanted to step back but was not allowed to do so even though my luggage had not yet been scanned. Going through getting my boarding card stamped for exiting again and then walking back to the post office took a long time. Then with 30 minutes left before boarding time it was impossible to get something korean to eat as all food places were too busy and asked for 45 minutes wait!

Up stairs after security Plenty of shops all open (it was 2pm anyway) with your pick of coffees Subway Pies also a Newsagent with nearly everything in it for the flight. Toilets were very clean a credit to the cleaning staff at the airport everything was clean. But once I had to go up to the concourse to my gate there was only one little coffee shop with big prices.

The whole procedure took about 20 minutes. This is far quicker than it takes at Dubai airport where although you don't have to get an visa the queues for passport control are huge and very slow moving.

For a small country of 1.2 million it is basic but has all the usual facilities even if it's not particularly attractive. There is a baggage security check just before the check-in counters although it isn't particularly thorough and queuing was a bit chaotic. Two lounges are available for First and Business Class passengers one of which is handled by Air Mauritius. This is the one I used for a Singapore Airlines flight. Again it did the basic job and had all the usual facilities such as internet fax machine shower and so on. Also a lot of staff on hand which seems to be standard in hotels and restaurants on the island. Okay overall. One thing to remember is that immigration control on arrival in Mauritius are keen that all visitors leave in due course - and insist on seeing an onward ticket.

At 5.30 in the morning you don't expect to be greeted by any queues! I dread to think what the situation will be this Easter weekend or in the summer. The problem is easy to see and the designer of the security area wants sacking. You cannot pick up a tray until you get to the X-ray machines so there is no way to start preparing to remove liquids belt jewellery coat boots laptop coins and everything else that has to go in the tray. Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again.

One of our party said that they were allowed to go up an escalator when the queue ahead was stationary at the top one elderly woman fell with others coming up the escalator behind. We went through the automatic recognition passport channel which required a further 30 minutes others in our party went through the ""manned"" channels and were out in half the time. It took us over an hour from getting off the plane to leaving Passport Control; we then had to collect our bags go through customs and then queue for the car park bus. If this is the queuing time at midnight on a Monday out of peak periods I never want to go near Stansted at a weekend in the peak season.

Most people complain about going up 2 levels and down a level (down two levels for US flights) but its not that difficult I think people are just looking for something to complain about. Security is quick A lot quicker than most other international airports and it was a busy Monday morning when I was flying out. The duty free is fine Not as big as T1 but big enough.

It's really nothing special any more despite the improvements. Improvements which have been long overdue. My last trip through the airport did not meet with any major flaws. But then I live in the area and know what to expect. High food prices. Horrid arrival traffic and traffic management. Average time for baggage availability at the claim area. So so personalities at desks. But at least the airport is clean as it can be. However like other airports its audience is nearly a captive audience.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,P Baxter,United Kingdom,2014-04-09,I travel several times a month out of Manchester both long and short haul. It isn't the worst airport I use - it doesn't bus everyone like Brussels it doesn't make you spend ages changing terminals like Frankfurt it hasn't got the frankly insane organisation of Heathrow's immigration and it isn't as dirty and unpleasant as Liverpool (or have that airport's cringeworthy strapline). I find the staff friendlier than average but there are a couple of serious issues. Terminal 3 immigration is seriously inadequate for the number of flights. If all desks are manned long queues still arise regularly. The Duty Free layout in Terminal 1 is a disgrace and shows a deep seated contempt for the customer as just another object to extract money from. It is clearly designed to disorientate the passenger in the hope that they will wander about the shops and buy something. Nothing like it anywhere else in the hundreds of airports I have visited. The people who man the Meet and Greet service aren't properly trained - they never offer the Fast Track pass if you buy M&G Plus unless you ask. Conversely if you haven't bought it just ask and they will give you one as they clearly haven't got or can't be bothered to check the information as to what you are entitled.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The most disrespectful treatment of passengers starts here queues to immigration are mind-blowing. Took 2 hours to get through and once you reach the counter it takes 20 seconds to get a stamp this makes you wonder what is taking the time? Could be that one immigration booth is constantly chit chatting with each other or another one having lunch during work time. Also there were only half of the booths open. No aircon so with 1000 passengers and 2 hrs you will feel dirty as ever upon arrival to Kuala Lumpur. After immigration finding a taxi or bus is a joke again no sign.

Finding taxiing times after landing increasingly long. More often than not planes are parked on the tarmac and passengers have to be bussed to and from the terminal. There are long wait times when this happens because they use fairly large busses and don't leave till they are filled up. So if you are one of the first folks on the bus - it's normal to wait 15-20 minutes for it to leave.

Aside from the dated concrete-tunnel design of the terminal building the way the entire clearance process is laid out for passengers arriving on international flights and transferring to domestic ones is quite illogical. Arriving passengers have to walk through a narrow walkway to arrive at the immigration checkpoint which is in a room clearly too small to handle the number of passengers passing through. Our flight arrived in the afternoon together with 12 other international flights as a result of which the room was overflowing and stuffy. TSA had 10-12 counters open for US citizens and about 6 for non-citizens. The total time taken for us to clear immigration and customs was 1.5 hrs. The flight we were connecting to was placed at the other end of the tunnel and had our incoming flight not arrived half an hour prior to scheduled time we certainly would have missed our connecting flight despite a planned 2 hour gap from disembarkation to boarding!

Very cheap and convenient train link nice friendly staff and quick security due to small nature of people passing through. However this has al changed. The cutbacks are in place and showing. My last visit had very tedious queues at security. Bags are put aside with gay abandon but limited staff mean they are not checked for some while. They point blank refuse to open both security points regardless of the fact that almost all passengers for each flight arrive around an hour before. If you finally get past security its all getting a bit shabby. No windows mean it is claustrophobic and a bar full of beer louts is the most prominent feature. Staff insist in letting passengers though into boarding but leave them waiting in a grotty corridor for ages every single time!

After a coached journey to the terminal (some planes use jetties) it was straight into the immigration hall (currency exchange immediately on the right) which had a couple of lanes for “non Arab passports”. The lines moved quite quickly and we were soon into the baggage hall where our bags were waiting. Customs took no interest and one is soon landside where there is an ATM (one of a small working number in Syria) a Currency Exchange and minor shops. We were met on arrival so I cannot comment on ground transport arrangements but there did seem to be numerous “taxi drivers” seeking fares.

There are usually queues but this beat them all and there shouldn't be any excuses about the Aussie fruit fly slowing things down.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,NA,2010-01-08,"Used DME during the Christmas/New years season. Arrival was quick and I was through immigration customs et al. within half an hour. Limited exchange facilities--one bank with several locations and exchange rates that are slightly less favorable than intown. Getting to the Pavaletsky-bound train means going into the domestic terminal a lengthy walk with many signs although a couple are a little confusing as to direction. The train leaves every 30 or 60 minutes depending on time of day. On New Years (a big holiday in Russia) it was running to Pavaletsky but not to the airports. For departure I arrived early (3+ hours) because it was a holiday (New Years) and new procedures were rumored to be in place for US flights (turned out not to be the case). The train from Pavaletsky was not running in the am - taxi was R1500 (after an initial ""offer"" of R2000) - a hair-raising but uneventful ride. Note that the limited food/shopping options and non-existent seating on the ground floor of the departure terminal are just part of the story--seating and food/shopping are on the second floor. Passport control and security screening were uneventful and reasonably efficient. The departure areas are filled with upscale stores and the usual duty free stuff. Expect to pay 50-100% more for food and drink than you would in the city. Most airports seem to have stopped this kind of nonsense. I saw no place to exchange money beyond passport control so you should change at the ground floor bank kiosk by the check-in counters.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After check in we were sent to the SriLankan shared lounge at Gate 22 Terminal 2 without being given alternate information on where exactly the plane was boarding. Our flight was also not shown on the in lounge screens as well. Upon asking about our flight which should have commenced boarding the lounge assistant tore our boarding pass rushed us to a gate down the ramp and ushered us onto a bus. After 2 minutes I left the bus and walked across the tarmac to ask for our boarding passes and passports. She began taking us back to the lounge. It appeared that our flight was near closing time for boarding and we were really concerned. After running about 100 meters back toward the terminal we finally found a screen only to see that the plan was in fact our plane and that it was about to close for boarding. We had to run all the way back to the plane and made it as they were announcing for us by name. I have never seen a more disorganised airport and more useless lounge staff and I must compliment them for their incompetence. The airport itself was disorganised and we stood in the checking queue with two people in front of us for 45 minutes trying to check into J class.

Still it is the only decent place to sit and wait. Then you go through another security check into a waiting room (full no seats left) then downstairs again to board the actual flight.

In all it took me 25 min to get through the body scanner leaving me 5 min to run to the boarding gate. Got there 5 min late - the gate had closed. What's the point of fast-tracking people 30 min before their flight when it takes 25 min to pass through security?

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Anne Simpson,NA,2006-02-26,We were a family of two adults and two kids travelling from Prestwick to Disneyland Paris. As Beauvais airport is about 117kms from Disneyland and relatively expensive for four to get there and back we decided the cheapest way was to hire a car and print out a route planner from the A.A. to make our destination easier to find. Getting there was not a problem and took just over an hour but coming back on the Sunday evening heading in the direction of Paris was a different story. The traffic was heavier and we got lost a few times which might not have happened had we taken a decent map with us. The car was due back at the Hertz Rental by 7pm and as we were running a bit late we decided to wait till we got to Beauvais before topping up the fuel. There was a gas station 2kms from the airport but unfortunately it was closed . As we didn't have the time to start looking about for another we took the car back and was charged 57euros for the half tank of diesel we used. Make sure you top up en route when you find a station otherwise it could end up being a very costly car hire. Otherwise Hertz were very reasonable at £73 for the 3 days hire and we were given a brand new Peugeot which let us get about and discover some good designer outlets very close to the Parks and a big shopping centre at the junction of the A104 9kms from Disneyland. It had a big Carrefour supermarket. We were able to purchase fruit salad cold meat and rolls to do us while in the Parks as what they offer in the Parks is total junk food and very costly. The other good thing with hiring a car is you can then choose a cheaper hotel to stay at a bit further away from the parks and if you have the yearly pass for the parks you can park at the parks for free otherwise it is 8 euros each day you park there. It would probably work out even cheaper to take our own car and drive all the way there but we were limited for time and we did get exceptionally cheap tickets with Ryan Air having booked well in advance. I hope this information will be useful to future travellers with kids and on a limited budget.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There are few stores once you get out into the arrivals hallway. Just a bunch of taxi bullying you into using them. The rail station is downstairs with few signs it is dark and dingy. Trains run every hour and people just abandon their luggage carts in the walkway by the train doors so it becomes an obstacle course to get on and off. No staff collect the carts. When we arrived by train to fly out it was just as bad. They security-screen your luggage as you enter the airport but don't seem to care if you set the metal detector off. We arrived 5 hours in advance. Most PA announcements are in French and Moroccan Arabic very few in English. The check-in opened 3 hours in advance of the flight and we got through Immigration and Customs easily enough. However the departure lounge is horrible. Over priced duty free shops and an overpriced Internet cafe ($10 per hour). There are no lounge chairs. All chairs have arms so you can not lie down across open seats.

Security is simply a money making scam at this airport. The only liquid I had was an anti-bacterial gel less than 100ml which I took out of my carry on bag and placed in the tray for x-ray. The security person said it needs to be in a re-sealable clear plastic bag. I asked for one he said they were £1 each. I said the anti-bacterial cost less than that and he could keep it. I then noticed the person in front of me had several loose liquid bottles in their tray (not in a bag) and pointed it out to him. He said ""I didn't check that tray my colleague did"". However this wasn't the only issue my wife never takes liquids out of her handbag when going through security and she's been pulled up on it every time at Gatwick Stansted and Heathrow. My wife was behind me this time at Luton airport security and again left her liquids in her bag. They went through the x-ray machine and no one pulled her up on having liquids in her handbag and it wasn't one little mascara but several liquids in small bottles such as cosmetics nose drops and an anti-bacterial.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,M Lixenberg,Israel,2013-07-17,Used T1 this summer. Long queues at passport control and extremely long distances to walk even with the conveyors but all that was nominal compared with the horrendous experience leaving from T1. The idiocy with the liquid strictness is terrible. At least put up signs so we could put things in our suitcases before they were checked in and not have valuable drinks creams etc even water thrown away. Seems they want the stores there to make money. But worst of all was the security scanning. They were abrupt and rude. inefficient and chatted with each other instead of giving service. My bag was re hauled and pulled apart after having waited 20 min all because of an empty bottle. It astounds me that a scanner cannot see if there is liquid or maybe they are down right incompetent.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Logic and experience at other gateway airports indicates that bags are checked through to the final destination; even the layout of the airport supports this with the only customs facilities available at the exit; the ""connecting flight"" route offered no facility for inspection or indeed passing transit bags to the airport. Is this only for connecting passengers without luggage? I think not. As it happened my bags went astray anyhow so the problem for me was academic.

Jinan airport on first impression is bright and modern. Yet among Chinese airports it surely must be rated as one of the worst. Passport check was quite inefficient and slow. This due to the security check which not only had very limited space meaning that passengers pile up waiting and bags pile up when leaving the x-ray. The check was unusually strict. As a frequent business traveller I always carry the same items yet here my bag was searched quite a bit and resubmitted for check. Once behind security there were limited facilities. Heating had been switched off so the airport was freezing cold. The coffee shops were simply disgusting with respect to their hygiene while the coffee was amazingly overpriced. Unlike most other airports in China Jinan does not provide free Wifi rather a fee version. Seating became rapidly limited as delays piled up. Lounges are quite grotty as well.

I would prefer to use STN over LHR (apart from T5) and over LGW. Security is now a breeze with many lanes open and never waiting time longer then 15 minutes even in the busiest times. Both landside and airside have a good variety of retail stores not as many as LGW or LHR but at the end of the day it is a low cost airport. Satellite 1 and 2 are connected by a train so no need for a long walk and if you are flying on FR walking times are not any longer then at LGW when leaving from furthest gates and certainly much shorter then at some other airports (AMS CDG etc). Airport itself feels very airy light and refreshingly new. Arrivals have been done up and now the immigration flows quickly especially if you travel on a new passport with the chip as you can use the automated barriers.

Starts with Poorly labelled passport control for Canadians with discourteous staff when asked for assistance. If you follow the visitor signs it doesn't work as you're supposed to follow the American stream. The American stream is only labelled as citizen and residents. Even when using the automated terminals you are still processed by immigration officers asking questions. The whole process is very time consuming. Strike 1. Next is getting luggage and going through customs. Not nearly enough officers (3) on duty to process the crush of humanity from several arriving planes a problem for passengers with connecting flights. The lineup for processing is not well organized and seems to be a free-for-all. Strike 2. Once through the signage and assistance of rechecking baggage is lacking. We had 2 oversized bags that no one wanted to deal with as they had to do real work as it involved a ""walk down"" with the bags instead of using the automated conveyor. Strike 3. Next was going back through security with all the connecting passengers. Many people with just 2 lanes open for processing. Strike 4. Now to find the trains to get to the proper terminal. Did I mention the poor signage? Strike 5. Don't get me started on the trains. Strike 6. The gates can be very far away from the train stop. Strike 7.

At security the queues were surprisingly short (see immigration issue) but they still insisted on swabbing bags and items unnecessarily, even lifting chocolates out of my daughters bag and re-scanning them - why?

Many of the gates are not just gates with waiting areas rather restaurants shops and other facilities. When departing the gate area for the international flights around gate G4 were packed with people and rather claustrophobic and there was nowhere to sit unless you wanted to be in one of the restaurants. This particular day the outside temperatures were close to 100 F and it was hot in the terminal. Also the distance between gates can be quite far.

A regular issue at all terminals is the poor management of security checks. Passengers are forced to walk loaded with plastic trays and trolleys to the conveyor before security. Some old people barely manage. When this was pointed out to the Security attendant he said ""this layout is not for the passengers confort but for our confort"". Just goes to show how much they care. After removing all metal objects the gate pinged as I passed through. After asking what had pinged (for my info to avoid it in the future) I was told I did not need to know and was subsequently frisked. Frisking is done in view of all the rest of passengers. After the walk to the conveyor belt how much more humiliating can it get? Terminals 12 and 3 are certainly dated but they wok efficiently to get you in and out fast. Terminal 1 was clearly a late addition and there are some long distances to manage but not too bad. Lines in general are manageable and baggage actually comes out very fast from these terminals. What I do not get is the design of Terminal 4. It is clearly designed to make it look nice but not to be good for managing passengers and planes. An architecture principle states that form follows function but not in the case of Terminal 4. The main building is 1200 metres long which makes impossible to walk through in less than 15 minutes to exit from one of the ends. Huge baggage claim areas with unused belts still on average it takes 50 minutes to get the baggage from landing. This may be very pleasing to the architect but I hate it.

detroit-airport,/airport-reviews/detroit-airport,Detroit Airport customer review,Matt Temple,United States,2015-05-31,For international departure DTW is ideal. For international arrivals DTW is to be avoided at all cost. The gross incompetence of TSA and US Customs at DTW amazes me. It took me almost two hours to slug through security and customs at DTW after arriving on time on a scheduled flight. DTW personnel (of which there are many but poorly trained) seemed taken by surprise by the arrival of my flight. TSA lines were needlessly long due to severe understaffing. DTW and TSA seem to have conspired to hire many employees to shout instructions to arriving passengers to cram into inadequate screening lines rather than to provide more screening lines. Avoid arriving at DTW from an international airport at all costs: TSA + DTW = totally inadequate to the point of utter incompetence. Delta and KLM: this is a major hub for your international operations. Why do you routinely subject your unfortunate customers to such mistreatment at DTW?,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I fly to Asia on a regular basis and even airports in such developing countries as Mongolia Myanmar Bangladesh and Nepal have more user friendly processes than LAX. It amazes me that the US with all its other attractions for visitors would continue to discourage international visitors by treating them the way the Immigration Customs and Homeland Security do at LAX. On my last visit there I spent 1.5 hours in a queue standing in a dirty hot arrival hall. The staff were disinterested and rude. No smiles or 'welcome to the US'. Whoever is responsible for the management of this place should hang their head in shame.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,J. Igor Prieto,NA,2004-08-10,I have lived in Palma for the last year or so and used the airport frequently. I agree that this brand-new terminal is spacious and well-designed. The only too often long distance involved in getting to your departure gate is pleasantly shortened though efficient moving walkways. The airport is conveniently located near the city and cabs are plentiful. The bus option is equally convenient and certainly cheaper although it should be noted that buses are not entirely reliable when it comes to getting to/from the airport either early in the morning or late in the evening. Negative aspects include: The blunt inadequacy of the existing catering facilities in the departures area. These are basically limited to two (twin) self-service outlets with a more than limited and certainly overpriced range of products. Tables are scarce and dirty. one often has to remove what others have left before. The only existing restaurant is poorly located at one end of the terminal and consequently often passes unnoticed by the traveller. The standards of cleanliness can be much improved. The otherwise pleasant relaxing open-air area is often found in appalling conditions with rubbish and bird droppings scattered all over the place. The retail facilities are small and unattractive. The perfume bar is normally crowded and rather inconveniently located at one end of the duty-free supermarket selling groceries and other stuff which is rather off-putting during the perfume-shopping experience. Non-smoking regulations are bluntly ignored by both travellers and staff alike. The only two existing passport and security control areas often mean that the traveller faces a rather long queue. The arrivals halls are cold and depressing. The low concrete ceiling creates an oppressive atmosphere. As in many other airports in Spain smokers automatically light their cigarettes the moment they get here when smoking is theoretically not allowed in this area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

goa-airport,/airport-reviews/goa-airport,Goa Airport customer review,Durvankur Patil,India,2014-05-05,The biggest difference that you see at the Dabolim airport is the brand new terminal. The old one floor terminal resembled more like a bus stand than an airport. The new terminal is quite big but the space seems to be wasted and very haphazardly organized. There are two entrances for the Departure area depending on the aircraft carrier which makes more sense and less of chaos. Once you pass that the entire concept goes for a toss. You need to scan your check in bags first for which the scanners are kept in a corner. Also the check-in counters face the other side rather than facing the entrance so you end up wasting precious time going circles. The security check takes place on the first floor which seems like a long walk if you're check-in counter is on the other end of the terminal. Once you pass the security hold you take the escalator up to the second floor which is the waiting area for the departures. The security moves pretty swiftly and the queues don't seem to bother you much. The waiting area is quite big but with randomly placed seats which are mostly occupied with luggage rather than travellers. There are a few shops and only a single restaurant (Golden Chariot) in the waiting area. The main boarding actually takes place two floors below so you end up climbing down the winding ramps where you finally see the aero-bridges. Well one good thing is that you at least don't have to take a bus to your aircraft. The arrival hall is pretty small with a couple of baggage reclaim belts which gets quite crowded and chaotic with multiple flights arriving post afternoon. Dabolim airport converts into a defence airport for around 5-6 hours during which the civilian aircraft movement is completely ceased.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

On the return at 4 pm no line at immigration or customs and even though only one flight arrived in the hour they had a reasonable 10-12 desks open for 200 people which probably was a max wait of 15 minutes for people at the very back of the plane. Luggage took less than 5 minutes the only problem was a 20 minute wait in the cab line with only 1 cab showing up during that time.

kathmandu-airport,/airport-reviews/kathmandu-airport,Kathmandu Airport customer review,John Chambers,NA,2010-01-12,"Everybody hates this airport (I'm talking the International Airport here) but I don't see why. I have been through over 40 times in the last 10 years and have had no problem. OK - its not (thank goodness) LHR or JFK but they do their best. My tips for an easy arrival. Either get a visa in advance (a multiple one if you intend to travel on/back to Tibet or Bhutan so you can g2et in and out of Nepal) or get off the plane sharpish and get to the front of the ""visa on arrival"" queue on the far lest as you enter. The latter can actually be quicker if the airport is not frantic with incoming flights. Be polite and don't make a show of presents or flashy kit in your baggage. Playing it low profile being quiet and reserved I have never ever been stopped or searched by anybody in this airport and have never had any fuss with Customs or immigration. On departure - get there early and fly business class if you can possibly afford it - there are absolutely no queues at the J class check in desks. Otherwise try to get an airline loyalty card and use this to check in at the J Counter. If even one party in a group has a J ticket the J class man will check Y passengers in with him as well. Departure immigration is slow as in most airports in this region but they seldom make a fuss. Last time my wifes visa on arrival had been stamped in my passport by mistake (and vice versa) and that didn't phase them at all - remember be polite and friendly - they get really miffed with surly people! J Class Departure Lounge is actually now very good - really! The old one was rubbish but the new one is a haven in an otherwise pretty stark departures area. C'est la vie. The final police check to go to the gate can be trying. They want to confiscate mainly lighters matches and batteries (and some even look for illegally exports of cash) by I find that being pleasant with a light banter usually lets me keep most things but keep money in a secure non obvious place in your bag or even in your pockets rather than in your bag just in case you fall foul of any real or imaginary currency export regulations. I have never had any problem and I always take over the limit out in Nepali Rupees so I have cash for my next trip. On the other hand the domestic airport is quite simply a dirty smelly disorganised hell hole and a disgrace to Nepal. If you are a lone traveller or do not have a guide it can be intimidating so my only comment is don't travel without a local guide or otherwise who knows his way around.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I had to use Liverpool last month because I wanted to fly to Seville on a Friday and back on a Monday. I breathed a sigh of relief at security which is now three times the area it used to be and has many more scanners open and I was through in about 5 mins. However on my return I had to wait almost 50 mins to get through immigration and 25 of those were spent queuing outside before I even got into the immigration hall. The reason was that two other aircraft had landed just before mine. Fortunately it was sunny but extremely windy and I am only glad it wasn't in the winter.

hyderabad-airport,/airport-reviews/hyderabad-airport,Hyderabad Airport customer review,Robert Deluga,NA,2006-01-14,Small and efficient airport somewhat slow staff and nothing remarkable. Arrival and Departure lounges are separated Arrivals on the ground floor and Departures on the first floor accessible to vehicles by a ramp so picking someone up or dropping some one is quite easy. Parking fees have gone up sharply to Rs.50 / hour so watch out. Inside the terminal its like any other airport in India designed in a cramped way and not maintained very well. TV screens that are supposed to show flight arrivals and departures show too much advertising and are not very easy to read. Check in and security procedures are quick but passport control can take a long time if there is insufficient staff when you pass through. Police officers and other staff are friendly and alert. The departure waiting area can comfortably hold passengers for 2 planes the only small coffee shop starts with Rs.30 for a coffee ! There are 3 airbridges which have been in use every time I passed through this airport so boarding and deplaning are quite quick. For passengers arriving from domestic flights baggage claim is quite fast. For international arrivals all baggage is first screened by customs to identify any goods that attract tax. This happens out of your vision so be patient until the luggage is screened and put on the conveyor belt. If you see a big white cross made with chalk on your luggage it means the screening officer inside thinks you have something to declare and the customs officers at the exit will catch you if you pretend otherwise. Once out of customs before getting out of the airport locate and use the prepaid Auto and Taxi counters to pay your fare first get a voucher and take the Auto / Taxi whose vehicle number is indicated on the voucher.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,K Yoshida,China,2013-07-09,I am working in Beijing but never liked Beijing Capital airport especially T3. It is a modern huge facility managed by fewer-than-necessary and inefficient staff. Many seemingly impressive facilities are simply unstaffed and unused. Long queuing is a must for check-in (even with E-ticket have to line up with paper-ticket passengers just to check luggage) no airline staff available to help you auto-check-in though more than half of the ticket- issuing machines are out of order or accept only Chinese national's ID not passports. Security check is time- consuming and what I hate most is the long walk from the departure lobby to the gate. Souvenir shops all sell same things and priced 3-5 times more expensive than in the city. T1 and T2 are much smaller and quicker to go through but the airlines using T1 and T2 are somewhat penalized for longer taxing time. Baggage handling is very slow (at least 30 minutes) and misleading (they put wrong flight number at a wrong counter I have encountered this problem at least 3 times). During Summer the airport often closes due to rain or other natural causes and their dealing with passengers is just horrible. We are left to wait without any sound update for more than 4 hours.

However we then had to join the chaotic scenes of security. One man checking the boarding passes of 2 charter flights (leaving within 15 minutes of each other) then onto security. Whilst I do not mind any level of additional scanning and checks the method that these were conducted was shoddy. There was one x-ray machine in use and many staff just stood around. We were asked to remove all electrical items from the hand luggage to go into separate plastic boxes. As we were doing this (on the floor as there were no tables to place our items on) the staff were tutting. Once we go through the person scanner the staff were telling us to move on into departure despite our items still being in a queue to go through the x-ray machine. I know this chaos is not a one off as when we returned from our holiday the place was late into Majorca and the cabin crew said that this was because of problems at Blackpool with getting staff through. The Jet2.com flights are weekly from Blackpool and clearly the airport cannot cope. We for one will not be flying from Blackpool again choosing Liverpool or Manchester (who have the same level of security but it is managed in a capable and professional way - unlike Blackpool).,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I was travelling with a group that included my mother who had a large leg ulcer my heavily pregnant sister and a 22 month old toddler. Security was like being led into a cattle pen with no divisions for crowd control until half way through. Reaching the scanners took around half an hour. Once we made it to the scanners my mother sister baby and brother in law were all 'randomly' picked for frisking delaying us even further. A 20 minute walk to the boarding gate was difficult for both my mother and sister and despite asking for help for my mother three times it was refused as we hadn't booked assistance 24 hours early and were helpfully told that we would miss the flight! Which we did! Then we were told to return to security so another long walk back except this was not where we had to go! My exhausted heavily pregnant sister then tried to buy some water before we continued wandering round the airport trying to find the right place to be but the cashier refused to sell it because she had accidentally brought the wrong boarding pass into the shop! A kind woman behind her in the queue took pity and bought it for her. A security officer about to go on his tea break then sees my mother and realising that she is in distress and helped us by leading us to the right place to reclaim our baggage. Here was the only decent person we met working at this airport. We picked up our baggage and then went to Ryanair customer services where my mother and sister found some seats to sit down and rest. We had been at the airport since 5.00 and it was now 8.00 so they had been on their feet for three hours. However they were then approached by a member of staff and told that they couldn't sit in those seats as they were for people needing special assistance!

I appreciate there is a need for security but when they are just standing around talking & appear to be in no rush I guess it makes TSA look good. British Airways need to be aware that the poor customer service is a reflection on them so they do need to ensure there is a level of customer service set in line with their excellent customer service BA provide. The other area which is annoying is the amount of walking to go from Fast Track which is next to the BA Lounge to then walk halfway down the terminal only to double back on yourself. We all know it is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the numerous shopping outlets which the majority of business passengers ignore so come on BA & BAA allow the business passenger direct access to the BA Lounges next to Fast Track as most of us have no interest in buying anything from the shops in T5.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Security check had several lines open and only 2 people in front of me but it still took ages: had to put really everything through X-ray (even my passport and boarding pass) then after having passed through the metal detector had to wait 5 minutes for my stuff stuck on the conveyor belt because the employee responsible to move the trays for the last meter had decided to take a break (passenger in front of me tried to reach for his tray and was quite impolitely told to not even think about it). Lots of walking between my gates and then a long bus ride (with no heating despite the -7) to the plane. Signage not extremely clear (felt it made me zigzag through the whole airport) but not as bad as at CDG.

amman-queen-alia-airport,/airport-reviews/amman-queen-alia-airport,Amman Queen Alia Airport customer review,Ben Weston,NA,2005-03-08,Passed through here on a World Business Class ticket with KLM en route to Amsterdam. Upon arrival the first impressions weren't good. The place looked shabby and worn and the immigration was a little disorganised though mercifully didn't take long compared to places like Dubai. One tip you have to buy a visa which costs 10 JD but the little money exchange counter in immigration didn't seem to be open when I passed through. I'd get your JD's before arriving to prevent big delays if you pitch up when it's closed. The Departure terminal is better but is a far cry from the slick Beirut airport. The duty free section however is very good and the business class lounge is pleasant if a little understocked with food and drinks - the selection is basic. I became a little annoyed at the immigration queues which moved painfully slowly and then the officer closed the desk as I reached the front of the queue!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The staff who were in control at the fast track that morning had a serious attitude problem and would make a guess some were working to rule. If not so whoever trains manages supervises and is responsible for them is operating a total basket case. The worst experience in a long time and a promise to myself I will never ever transit through this airport again.

lisbon-airport,/airport-reviews/lisbon-airport,Lisbon Airport customer review,Lone Davidsen,Denmark,2013-10-15,"Yesterday I spent a day in Lisbon Airport - with my husband and our friend (83 years old lady). We were part of a group of 8 who were supposed to take off at 9.35. Arrived at the airport early used the self service check in and went for the queue for baggage drop (very long). After waiting a long time the 3 of us were shown to a counter where we spent 45 minutes while the man behind the desk kept talking on the phone. We finally got rid of our bags and went to drop our golf bags at the odd size luggage counter. Next queue was the security check. Again we waited in a long queue and experienced inefficiency from the staff. Finally we came through and went for a short visit to the lavatories and started the long walk to gate 10. Arriving at the gate we were told that the gate was closed. The two very friendly ladies made some calls and tried to fix it so we could get on the plane - but unfortunately that was not possible - the procedure to unload our bags from the plane had already been started. We got instructions to go back to ""customer service"" - and then the nightmare started: We followed the instructions and walked through the airport to find the customer service which was not easy. We had to ask for the way several times and each time we were sent in the opposite direction. After having been back and forth in the airport (passing gate 15 about 5 times) we found a friendly man who gave us correct directions to customer service. Told to go to the ticket office. After some more walking around we found the ticket office where we were told to buy new tickets to the next flight. After some arguing that it was not our fault that we missed the plane she came around a bit: we were lucky so we only had to pay for the difference in price for the two tickets. Back in the check in area we found the supervisor and we were provided us with new boarding passes and were told that we could go straight to security. At this time 2 hours since our original take off time had passed and we had almost 6 not very exiting hours to spent in the airport. If this is Lisbon Airports understanding of customer service we do not want to come back. We know that the airport is old and worn out but this is no excuse for the inefficiency of the staff.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,P Baxter,Australia,2010-09-27,Just spent 7 hours waiting in transit lounge at Delhi Airport whilst travelling London to Delhi with Air India and Delhi to KL with Air Asia in circumstances where my wife and I could have and should have spent no longer than 5 minutes in the area. The rule operating in practice is that you cannot transit until the airline which delivered you to Delhi signs you over and you are accepted by the airline taking you out again. This is so even where you are appropriately ticketed and have an internet boarding pass for the ongoing flight. So if there is no one available at your ongoing airline or no one processes your request from the arriving airline you simply sit and wait and are effectively left in limbo. The only way to get through is to constantly harass the staff to keep checking on where matters are for your particular case. You are invariably told each time you approach the desk by the person on the counter that they do not work for the particular airline that you are flying out on and the matter is not their responsibility. Air India appears to be the only company represented in the transit area. Many people are forced to spend long periods (in some cases more than 24 hours) confined in the transit room with no shops or other facilities. This is completely unnecessary where passengers hold ongoing ticketing. No one appears to be in charge or available to deal with passenger transit. You are just locked in a room and left to fend for yourself. I saw many very frustrated and distressed people unable to have their individual transit situations appropriately dealt with. The many individual staff members at the transit desk whilst personally pleasant were incompetent to handle the situation. The whole shambolic situation is a debacle. I was told by another passenger that on one occasion the security staff would not even allow travellers out of the room to go to the toilet for a period in excess of 3 hours.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,F Odds,United Kingdom,2014-04-29,What a dreadful airport! At terminal 3 today around 50% of the x-rayed bags in security were passed for hand screening and swabbing causing huge build-ups of frustrated passengers. Many airports recognize that people who've paid money to fly are not criminals per se but Manchester (terminal 3) likes to make everyone passing through get the feeling they are an unreasonable nuisance to mankind. At security the tray containing my jacket and laptop and the tray containing my cabin bag were both sent for manual screening. Incredibly the security chap solemnly looked me in the eye for the second time when it came to tray number two and asked exactly the same questions: did you pack this yourself? Could anyone have interfered? etc. Is it really impossible to add intelligence to security? Airside at Manchester terminal 3 every WHSmith and Boots outlet insists on production of a boarding card for all purchases. Many British airports ask if you object to showing your boarding pass and don't mind if you say 'yes' but Manchester won't sell you even a newspaper without your producing a boarding pass. This farce has gone on long enough. The food outlets don't ask you to show your boarding pass to make a purchase: why should Smiths and Boots?

These basement gates are also served by Swiss Int'l flights to London and Moscow for which pax are shuttled by bus. The area is dismal exacerbated by the low ceilings and minimal natural light. Seating space is limited. What made my experience so bad is that the various flights using these gates were heavily delayed by bad weather so there was a considerable crush of humanity.

Situated some 45 km out of town you can either use the SAS Flybussen (14 euros o/w) or train (20euros o/w) neither of which are cheap. I found it a bit odd that BA check-in desks were a bit of a free-for-all and that there was no seperate Club Europe desk. However if you've hand luggage only there are several self check-inmachines but you need to have the credit card used for the ticket purchase. A modest but comfortable BA Terraces lounge is available after security check but I guarantee you will go round in circles looking for it. Located on the domestic departures side it is very poorly signposted as the lounge attendant has probably been told 100s of times. Take the spiral staircase on your left after security and continue to the end of the corridor. DO NOT go to international departures after security as you won't be allowed to step back into domestic even though there's no barrier between the two.

The airport has many shops and lots of different places to eat from fast food places to nice restaurants. There is even a spa at terminal D if you have time. Yes there is always a line at customs and immigration but they seem to move it quickly. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this airport.

First it's quite small so there's not much to do there if you arrive early. On the other hand it does not seem have the benefits small airports normally have - fast and friendly service short distance from rental/parking over check-in/security to gate/flight. Rather the opposite. Rental car companies are situated miles away and you have to get on a slow bus to get there and back. Arriving at check-in a bit early there are no self-check-in counters and you just patiently have to wait until they decide to open the counter. Waiting there there's nothing to do no lounge or anything just a sorry bar. On the good side check-in and security was very fast much to my surprise. From the check-in counter opened and till I was in the departure hall no more than 10 minutes passed. Being in there was a bit sad.

Travelled with excess baggage including technical equipment (three boxes) requiring ATA carnet. Immigration area first; strong smell of diesel. Three lines with two officer booths each but possibility to go to booth on different line i.e. possible pushing in. Officer says nothing but takes ages to inspect your passport. Never mind it's a tourist visa. Collected bags from carousels. This is a small and chaotic area with people pushing trolleys into you at speed from all angles. Then customs: with ATA carnet went to area that looked like 'anything to declare'. Waved carnet at officer. He took us directly into a staff area at end of corridor is a customs office. They (old guy and a trainee) dealt with the relevant section of the carnet checked a few items communicated in English took photocopies. Had a cover letter in Russian explaining what purpose of equipment which helped. Were told to come back to the same place exactly when departing. This was pretty efficient. Leaving from DME: Travelling from area of KUNTSEVSKAYA Metro station (i.e. West Moscow) allowed four hours to departure. Orbital motorway anticlockwise pretty quiet at 0615AM clockwise direction was already very busy and slow. Kashira highway going south east to DME also OK. So that part in 45 minutes. Possible to drive to front of the only terminal get (free trolley) and go straight inside building. All baggage scanned just inside building but this was simple no delay. Went to the left (east) end of check in area to get to arrivals showed carnet to a the first customs-looking oficer available. He waved us to the staff area to have the next section of the carnet dealt with. No queues no problem. Documents were photocopied and we were on our way. Then back to check in area (waving carnet at anyone official) checked in personal baggage taken told to go to airline cashier desk (Swiss) to pay excess baggage. Showed checkin clerk the excess baggage receipt then took the three boxes to excess baggage reception. It was scanned and we pushed into a lift and said goodbye to it. Then went upstairs through passport control/security. This was no problem either (got waved into business lane for unknown reason). The whole process through the airport to now was less than an hour so had almost an hour to spare.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Eric Foxford,United Kingdom,2014-03-28,By far the worst airport I have experienced. Sadly it is often the most convenient for European visits. £2 for a Taxi drop off too far from the departures building. Then you have to pay for a trolley both going and upon your return. I dread what our overseas visitors think about that. Â£2 for the legally specified sized plastic bags to hold the regulation sized toothpastes / cosmetics face creams etc or else you will not be travelling. Then the chaos of the departure shopping mall. Minimum seating impossible departure signage almost invisible by neon screaming at you to come in and buy buy buy. Not a clock to be seen anywhere. Returning causes more anxiety it is not unusual for your baggage to take over an hour to appear on the carrousel shabby and miserable. To get a taxi for onward travel requires a pre arranged booking which is dodgy because you need to take into account the delayed baggage problem and heaven help you if it is raining and usually it does because you have the long trek to find the cab and again pay for a trolley and the £2 to release the cab from the car park.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Excellent but quite expensive food choices, free and fast wifi, very clean rest rooms, plenty of flight info boards, travelators to the more distant gates, no hassles at gate security, comfortable seating in gate lounges. boarding well organized. T2 late afternoon departure fine as well with no hold up checking in or at emigration. Less food choices than T3 and terminal is showing its age a little. But it is still clean and spacious. gate security and gate lounges fine. free wifi. T2 mid afternoon arrival involved a full on security check in the concourse. It was a little chaotic. Instructions prior to putting hand luggage on the belt and pax walking thru the scanner were contradicted by the personnel on the 'other side' which involved many pax having to go back and repeat the process. If they are going to do this they need to get their act together. Ipads are not lap tops! Again no queue at immigration and a short wait for bags.

However like Cairo there are very bad touts particularly on the forecourt. I haven't experienced the ones at check in as others have but this may be because of my flight time. Domestic check in is extremely chaotic and disorganised for departures with conflicting information. Arrivals (international) is similarly chaotic for people who have no organised visas in advance with long poorly organised queues for both visas and immigration (both with a shortage of workers). I recommend international visitors get a visa in advance as this will save a lot of frustration at Luxor as arrival is very disorientating with guides touts and unhelpful staff giving conflicting information.

Arrived on Lufthansa which uses an airbridge so it is just a few steps down a stairway and a 50m walk to get to the baggage carousel. After a 15 minute wait baggage arrives. No border controls so a real quick way out of the airport. Busses to downtown Vilnius and central station are a good option. The train to Vilnius station is a couple of minutes walk from the terminal building. Unfortunately the timetable in the airport arrivals hall does not match the - updated - timetable which is actually in force but only on display at the station platform. So save yourself the hassle and take the airport bus which departs right in front of the terminal. Bus tickets are for sale at the newsstand in the arrivals hall (2 Lats/ride). Departure from Vilnius is very easy. Friendly check-in and security staff. Low cost travellers be aware of the measuring devices they have installed on the security conveyor belts. Quite obviously all the boardcases to be screened must fit though that frame. Also they keep announcing the WizzAir and Ryanair luggage restrictions so it is better to adhere to them from the start.

It is clean well indicated inside with convenient facilities (bars shops duty free) At least you don't spend 1 hour to go through security checks and ground staff is nice. They recently refurbished car parks terminal buildings and a direct railway to the city center is being built (end 2009). The only drawback is terminal 3 because you have to walk for at least 20 minutes from car parks and it offers nearly no shops and bars and not enough seats! But I assume they will modify it a bit. As a frequent airport user I can tell you that this is one of the best in europe conserving human scale even though traffic is growing. LYS is now hub of Easyjet with many european destinations and a direct route to New-York will be opened this July (with 5 flights a week!).

This airport has the retro feel of something from the 1970s (even the moving walkways look totally obsolete). I can only speak for the EU- Schengen section of the terminal but all I can say is that the lack of services is woeful. In a country of such style and glorious food how is it that there are so few restaurants? And the under-staffed café at the departure gates is always overwhelmed with long lines.

Arrival; from aircraft landing to sitting on the bus to Termini - around 15 minutes if you only have carry- on bags.

I will avoid this airport at all cost in the future. We arrived into LAX for the outbound leg of our trip luckily we had our bags transferred by the airline so we did not have to collect our bags first. We had to go from on of the more distant terminals from the International Terminal. We waited outside for the shuttle but after 15 minutes we gave up and walked. There was a light evening rain but the walkways are not generally covered so by the time we got there we were a bit wet. The one bright spot was passport control was fast and the TSA was friendly. Now for the nightmare of the return trip. Immigration was nearly a 90 minute wait. My wife is a PR of the US and she and I was told to go into the US line. Once there the TSA officer was rude disrespectful to me and my wife and despite the TSA mission statement was completely unprofessional. We then collected our bags and waited for another 45 minutes to get out of customs and it would have been longer if we would have been selected to have our bags screened. Went to Terminal 6 which was a construction zone surprised they didn't issue us hard hats. While I know LAX is in desperate need of terminal updates sitting in a terminal and hearing hammers for 90 minutes before a flight can give you a headache.

There's not much to do at this airport. The one advantage of this airport is that it is just 5 minutes from the CBD. So usually I go to the airport just one hour before departure. Check-in can be quite long if you arrived 2 hours before departure. The airport is clean (due to the size). Adelaide Domestic Airport is pretty average. The airport is actually quite dirty probably due to the influx of people in the airport every hour. There isn't enough seats though. Check-in is quick.

The latter is upstairs no lift or escalator is apparent. Those with luggage with children or with physical limitations are disadvantaged. The B departure gate lounges are ludicrously small and 3/4 of passengers on a major flight will have to stand for up to 3/4 hour before boarding. on 21st April 2007 a situation arose in which it was very fortunate that no accident or panic occurred at the bottom of the escalator to the shuttle bus for a late flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It took 20 minutes from parking our car in the long stay car park to walking into the terminal queues at non-fast track security were very short and we were through in a few minutes.

zagreb-airport,/airport-reviews/zagreb-airport,Zagreb Airport customer review,Matjaz Jerman,NA,2003-03-21,"Airport is located some 20 km from the city center and there are good road connections to the airport. There are no rail connections. Bus connections are quite frequent and there is always bus connection with your flight (at least when flying Croatia Airlines - Croatian national carrier). Bus price is app. 35$. At the entrance to the airport there is policeman standing and controlling the traffic which is something I'm not used to. Short car park is charged at app. 1 $ per hour (March 2003). Airport itself serves domestic and international flights. It's not a big airport so do not expect a lot. There are few check-in desks. Politeness of staff depends on the people working but normally they are quite OK. Never have experienced rudeness. Airport interior reflects the period in which it was built. Some renovations were done but it's far from modern. When flying on domestic routes there is only one small waiting room which is not separated from the rest of the airport. After passing security control gates are next thing. No any shop no nothing. Directly to the gates. Passengers are always transported to the planes by busses. International departures are not much better. There is duty free whose variety of products can't be compared to other western or even central European. There is restaurant on the airport with rather expensive and quite non edible food. There is one carousel for domestic arrivals which is once again not separated from the hall for non- passengers. The room can be full of smoke as there is one bar near to it and smoking is allowed. International arrivals are catastrophic (or at least they were when flying there). Passport control officers are in small ""cabins"" and their attitude is one saying ""What the hell do you do here?"". Really rude (an this isn't just one of the officer all of them are like that). No smile no nothing. Decor is even more disastrous. Reminds me on communism era. There are lots of car rental offices on the airport won't comment decor of those (""great"" chairs in from of each one from before the WWII). To conclude: the airport itself is much worse than most of other central European ones. It is okay if you are flying Croatia Airlines as the staff there are really polite and willing to help.

When I got to security I thought it would take quite long but it had been really fast; 2 minutes to scan my hand luggage. After security there is a cafe bar located before you enter onto the terminal. Now this is where it gets hectic. You simply cannot breathe while you're trying to capture a picture of a plane on the tarmac. The people just smoke and smoke and basically you could just see everyone smoking in the bar. When I approach the toilets in the waiting hall I see them as third class squat toilets. They are so dirty and no one seems to clean them with detergent. This is what is hectic for foreigners but I am Chinese so I would understand this.

montreal-trudeau-airport,/airport-reviews/montreal-trudeau-airport,Montréal Airport customer review,P Rubenstein,Canada,2013-04-14,YUL is a third world airport characterized by some of the rudest personnel of any Canadian airport. The security personnel are not reassuring to put it politely. It is not uncommon to see some of the security personnel engaged deep in personal conversations with each other or on the telephone chattering away instead of doing their jobs. It would be nice if the personnel were comprehensible in one of Canada's two official languages. Gate personnel often have problems connecting the gates gangways to airplanes. Although the terminals are not as spread out as other airports it is a good thing as this is not an airport where one wants to spend time. The availability of food service airside is rather limited and the quality is dismal. Arriving late at night is a nightmare. Baggage can take up to an hour to arrive on one conveyor belt that is shared by multiple flights. The result is that PAX can crowd around one belt even though there are several other belts available. The arrivals baggage area is not secure as in other airports so non Pax can easily access the luggage belts (No security doors and no guard). The terminal especially the domestic arrival area is filthy. The parking lot is constantly under construction dark and dirty.

We were on a flight that originated in Barcelona then onto Amsterdam (where we did a complete security scan) onto Detroit. We passed through customs just fine with the declarations paper completed and verified by an officer before we collected our luggage. Then our luggage was late coming off the plane and by then other flights arrived making the customs line exceedingly long. We told 3 customs officers patrolling the area (there were another 4 just standing around doing nothing) that we had a flight leaving in 30 minutes. Each one said we would make it. Then we had to go through another security check (we just had one at the gate in Amsterdam). Well we missed the flight. The next one we were put on was leaving 6 hours later and did not have the option of an extra 4 inches of leg room previously purchased for our original flight. In Amsterdam by the way there was an express line through customs for those travelers that had a flight leaving in 30 minutes or less. Why US airports don't do this should be explored.

It's reasonably compact and efficient and immensely better than the huge mess that CDG is. The airport is clean not too old and although low French standards of customer service apply I found people generally more helpful than in Paris. Security is cleared rapidly must faster than checking in with easyjet. It usually takes 10-15 minutes when scarcely crowded but more like 30-45 mins when crowded which does not often happen in my experience. My son's stroller does not fit in the X- Ray machine which although annoying the first time is a good excuse to go to a no-queue special size security screening. However this has to be authorized by the air line company and if they don't you will lose a large amount of time (queue for nothing go back to check in...) This is the only airport where I flew with the stroller (LHR DXB CDG LGW) where it has been an issue. I have never experienced a delay greater than 10 mins through border control and customs because most flights are within the EC and there are few non EU citizens. On the bad side. The airport is not so far from the city but the Taxi cartel has been successful in preventing the arrival of the tram line. Your only link to the city (except Taxis) is through a bus which only goes to a few places like the railroad station. Count 1hr to get there. Duty free shops are very limited in choice.

On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all. Then the Taxi system waiting outside was totally out of control there were no lines or order to the process the waiting passengers it was every man for himself with Taxi's at one stage 3 deep across the road with people walking around moving cars.

The terminal is very poorly designed with unnecessarily long distances. What really drives me crazy is that when you arrive you end up in a hall which is not located at the same level of ground transportation so you must take either an elevator (there are just two of them!) or an escalator to reach the taxis / buses or the parking lot. If you have a large piece of luggage this can be quite difficult to manage. On the plus side I have never waited too long for immigration. Baggage collection on the other hand is variable (up to 1 hour once for a flight from Europe). Food choices are really limited considering the size of this airport.

Firstly living in Norwich it’s just a Taxi ride and with check in on most flights even international are only a 1hour and last check in 25mins what a saving on time. (Compared to a 2-3 hours drive and 3 hour check in) It is a lovely small airport but with all the usual facilities (bars food halls shopping car hire money exchange). The staff always seems to be very friendly helpful and flexible but then you can where passengers numbers are on smaller size. It also has a fairly high security outlook as they having taking photo’s at customs for years. Having KLM flying to Amsterdam 5 times a day we can get flights anywhere to the world anytime.

The following day I SMS'd the Bali Concierge services who requested what my arrival flight details were assured me they were at the airport from 11am to 11pm and if I'd like to use them for departure it would cost me another IRP125000.

People were sitting were they could - even on their suitcases. We were stuck in long queues for check-in - it seems that most flights only have two check-in desks then a massive queue for security but the final straw came at passport control with a queue that snaked round little wonder since they had only one man on duty who was painstakingly thorough! People all around us were getting upset as their flights were due to go in minutes and they had been held up in other queues. Then to add insult to injury once you passed through to the departure gates there was another big queue for the little snack kiosk.

Each instance at CDG was an unhappy ordeal that left me spent and breathless. Sparing the details the words asanine and ludicrous best describe the layout and navigability of this facility.

Staff texting on their mobile phones while waiting to escort staff from the plane. 3.

I was on the flight from South Africa - a long 17.5 hour flight which includes a 1 hour transit stop in Dakar Senegal. As I don't have an American passport I joined the queue for non-USA passports with other passengers who also had non-USA passports. We were then basically ignored by the officials/supervisors who tell you which queue you may go to. I admit our flight arrives early in the morning so it would appear there are not many immigration officers on duty at that time. I do not however think it is acceptable to take the 1 Immigration Officer appointed to deal with non-USA passport holders to assist USA passport holders - when there are already 3 officers helping them.

Although we only had 1.5 hours to make the connection we ended up relaxing for nearly an hour before the next flight. Consequently I was not concerned that we only had 2 hours on the way back. How wrong I was! It was a complete shambles. No one helped us. We had to queue in very long lines both for passport control and customs. None of the staff were interested that we had very little time to make our connection. We had to collect our cases and take them to the next flight. We caught the flight with 5 minutes to spare. Others missed it. It was like a different country let alone airport. In fact the transit I experienced in Minsk Belarus last year was a far better experience than this.

faro-airport,/airport-reviews/faro-airport,Faro Airport customer review,T Callan,United Kingdom,2013-06-20,I might be very lucky however Faro Airport which I use regularly is fine. People who complain about the staff and queues might take a closer look at what staff are all too often forced to deal with. How many times does the clear message regarding what the arrangements are when passing through airport security? Liquids up to 100 ml are allowed provided they are placed in plastic bags. Simple? Not enough it would seem from the number of folk who seem astonished when given this information yet again on reaching the scanner point. No wonder the queues are sometimes longer than they need to be. The patience shown by airport staff should be the real talking point and not the perceived lack of speed when dealing with our aircraft security. Most travellers of course do anticipate the need to reach the scanner unencumbered by items that require to be placed separately and cannot be on ones person when scanners do their work. However Faro Airport has its fair share of individuals who exert a negative influence out of all proportion to their numbers on the experience of fellow passengers. So we should be encouraging them to take a little time to reach the point of entry ready to place the required items in the separate tray. Also of course ensuring that they have nothing on their person to inevitably trigger the alarm and unnecessarily placing yet more avoidable demands on airport personnel. Overall when passengers extend the courtesy of being prepared for their security arrangements things run more smoothly. This also applies to Duty Free shops when the need to produce boarding cards seems to present some travellers with astonishment to the extent that they then have to unearth the contents of at least one bag before being able to complete what should be a simple transaction. This all takes time of course and leads to frustration for staff and fellow passengers. Overall therefore before rushing to judge Faro Airport and its staff possibly based on a fleeting snapshot take time to reflect on the contribution that you and others have made to the experience.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Queuing (or not) for Corsairs flights is a mess. It took about 1 hour to load the 747 (after a 5 hour delay) passengers standing on the stairs as the holding room was far too small.

montevideo-airport,/airport-reviews/montevideo-airport,Montevideo Airport customer review,Dale Hancock,NA,2006-01-27,Arrival at MVD was without incident. The TAM Fokker 100 parked away from the jetways & passengers were bussed to immigration. The line at immigration was effectively zero (Thursday about 10AM). Immediately after immigration & prior to picking up the luggage all hand baggage is x-rayed & the customs forms collected. As baggage is delivered to the terminal it is x-rayed before going onto the carousel for passenger pickup. Once the luggage was collected exiting was through another essentially non-existent customs station with everyone simply being waived through the “nothing to declare” line. Once exiting this area we exchanged a few hundred dollars at a 21.599 rate (the rate at the hotel was 22.14 and at currency exchange counters in the city about a peso more). Taxi fare into town (the Sheraton) was calculated based on a reading of the meter and a separate chart & came to $495 or about $23US. The cab did not have traditional cab markings on the outside. The ride took about 25 minutes. From the time of landing until sitting in the hotel room took less than an hour. On the return trip the cab rate was slightly less - $500 allowed a decent tip to the driver & all were happy. We arrived at the airport about 2 hours before flight time and had to wait about 10 minutes for TAM to open their counters. Once they opened check-in was quick this time (see report under SCL). From there down the hall (to the right of the check-in counters continue to the right of passport control & next to the pharmacy) to pay the $26US departure tax (they readily accept USD) then through the passport control line where a lady scans the tax receipts stuck to the boarding cards on to passport control and then on to the gate. Total time from leaving the TAM counter to sitting at the gate was about 10 minutes. There are only 9 gates at MVD. There is a restaurant before going through passport control but we did not stop. There were several tables & few if any customers – it’s between the airline counters & the pharmacy. If you need to eat at the airport stop here first. Once beyond passport control there is only a [very] small café (Vanila) that appears to have only the very basics. We recommend you eat before arriving at the airport. Duty free seemed expensive (JW Blue for $173US) – but it’s extremely rare when we believe we’ve found a good deal at any duty free shop. Overall MVD is a fine airport to visit.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

When we got to Houston they picked up my Mom and Aunt on a cart but it was full of other passengers so I couldn't ride with them. Since we had to go through customs we knew they would be taken care of in their wheelchairs. Turns out the cart guy dropped them off somewhere with no wheelchairs available and no one to assist. The guy also told them they would miss their connecting flight. So my 81 year old Mom and Aunt were wandering around the customs area and having to walk with their carryon luggage with no assistance. Since we had already passed customs and the ensuing security check (again) we couldn't go back to get them. Evidently no one can go back to customs to assist even airport personnel. We finally went back to the security area and just waited for them. Eventually they made their way through. We did indeed miss our connecting flight to OKC and ended up getting a hotel in Houston. If someone had indeed met them with wheelchairs at the gate in Houston (as they were supposed to) we would have made our flights and breezed through the airport process. There were 6 of us flying together on that flight we all missed it because we weren't going to leave them behind.

riyadh-airport,/airport-reviews/riyadh-airport,Riyadh Airport customer review,S Daehlen,NA,2005-12-02,King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh has four surprisingly small triangular terminals in a row. Terminal 1 is for international flights with foreign airlines terminal 2 is for international flights with Saudia and terminal 3 (Saudi by definition for the time being) is for domestic flights. Terminal 4 (the first terminal you pass when arriving by car from central Riyadh) is closed. The VIP section is placed between the two Saudi terminals thus preventing direct access from international to domestic flights. The terminals are not unattractive from an architectural point of view with a large (and noisy) cascading fountain in each and a multilevel roof construction that is vaguely reminiscent of the classical Ottoman mosques which also gives light to the interior of the terminal. Regrettably the airport does not seem to have undergone major renovation since it was built and the interior is dominated by shades of beige brown and dark red. Shiny chrome air-condition pillars and shabby plastic counters do not enhance the visual impression. Only once have I experienced that passengers have been required to use a bus instead of the elevated tunnel when leaving the aircraft. Facilities for passengers are scarce. Between the two international terminals you can buy some electronic equipment get a bite to eat or use the ATM/banking counter and in the terminal for foreign airlines there is a small shops selling newspapers dates cameras etc. before you pass through immigration and security. In all three terminals at the airport the departure halls themselves offer nothing except three snack bars.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

When we finally did get a wheelchair the attendant kept stopping to chat to friends other airport staff.

Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats.

Flew out of DUB at peak time early Friday evening and the airport was functioning well; no queues at passport and security control. DUB's major problem - and the works currently underway won't resolve this - is the lack of a fast ground transport link to the city centre. There are state-owned and private buses running to various points in the city centre but notoriously bad traffic means it will take you close to an hour to cover the 8km distance and at â‚¬6 the service is seriously overpriced.

They were very vague as to what we should remove from our bags to put in the trays for x-ray. I asked if we had to remove cables and wires and they did not answer so we left them in as you do on US flights. They then insisted that I empty a bag containing underwear in front of them. They then took my husband into a private room while they searched his bag. Surely a bit of kindness and common courtesy wouldn't go amiss? Later at the gate they asked over 150 of us to queue to have our boarding passes checked with our passports. We then sat down only to be asked to get up immediately to have boarding passes checked again as we boarded. It was laughable.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,P Iosad,Norway,2009-10-21,"AMS-YYZ-AMS using T3. Extremely long walking distances on arrival through empty corridors. Border guards meet you halfway but the check is only selective (I saw them checking people's passports and got mine out but was just waved through). Immigration officer was polite but extremely thorough wanted to know everything including why I live in Norway as a Russian citizen. Needing a visa to essentially everywhere makes one used to dealing with immigration but frankly this was the most thorough interrogation I've ever had. The whole immigration/customs thing is strangely organized (you fill in a card that the immigration officer checks and then you give it to the customs people). Didn't have any luggage so can't comment. Nothing special on arrival (pretty much a cramped room with a convenience shop) and no ATM would take my card (also brushed away rather rudely by the person in the currency exchange booth who barked they only dealt with cash - well why do they have a PIN pad sticking out then??) so had to the take the bus which you can pay for with the card. Departure was smooth printed out my boarding pass (on a computer with a really slow printer attached not a proper terminal) and into security which was reasonably fast but slightly chaotic (one officer instructed me to take metal objects off and then another told me to have my ""stuff"" on me). Once inside clean and tidy but nothing much of interest a few bland shops and sandwich/pizza places (again had problems with my card!). Boarding OK but they could do with a screen that is higher up or a better microphone: boarding is by row but everyone was trying to get closer to hear what they were saying so it was quite a scrum.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,M Burgess,New Zealand,2015-04-16,What a fiasco. No easy public transport connections - took us two hours from just outside CBD to Int'l using train/public bus/inter airport bus. Qantas check-in not open - hunted for immigration forms from other airline counters to fill out in advance. The hunt for public conveniences involved a long walk to the other side of Arrivals. When we spotted a desk being opened we were informed to return in half an hour and go upstairs to buy a coffee in the meantime. As we had business class tickets we hardly wanted to buy a coffee when we could get one in the Qantas Lounge. To kill time we humped our suitcases up the escalators and back to visit Duty-Free. Why paper immigration forms are needed to be completed is a mystery with electronic passports and e-visitor visas? At Security one of us had to get 'double' scanned on the passport they emptied our bags unravelled our umbrella - OK a forgotten water bottle is easy to miss we needed it to keep going during the 'wait' for check-in to open - and then left us to re-pack everything. The electric toothbrush was nearly confiscated due to them thinking it was a screwdriver. Inadvertently I left my mini screwdriver in my glasses case to tighten my loose glasses screws not acceptable apparently and had to wave goodbye to it. When we eventually reached the Lounge for that long awaited cup of coffee was heaving with alternative airline pax and nearly all the seats gone!

Customs and immigration are fairly straightforward although a little bit of French will help. The airport is a long way from Noumea so it is best to arrange a transfer with your hotel pre booking before you leave is the best. Arc en ciel was the best company we thought. Heading back out is always a nightmare at Tontouta there is no order for anything. Customs is always straightforward when departing. Only a small duty free on the other side and only 1 cafe. not much to do. There are no tv screens or monitors for the flights.

But LED has now taken that dubious honour. The airport is a tiny shoebox vastly underprovisioned for security checks passenger numbers and any suggestion of passenger comfort is a joke. There are three security scanners for the whole terminal (Terminal 2) and the average waiting time was 40 minutes on a Sunday afternoon (I shudder to think about peak business times). After customs you are fed into a second security scanner (only one of these). In the waiting area for your plane there are only a few available seats nowhere to go for food or drink (you can look through the glass to the land-side cafeteria) or duty-free (that is in the previous area) no power points for laptops and no Wifi. On the plus side the arrivals area was ok (clean spacious and enough shops)  but is also the only airport I've found that you need to go through a security scanner for the arrivals area. I'll make every effort to avoid this airport and advise anyone else to do the same.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

incheon-airport,/airport-reviews/incheon-airport,Incheon Airport customer review,Richard Mabbitt,Thailand,2012-08-05,I am a frequent business traveller and find this one of the most annoying and inconvenient airports. I just completed a return trip from Bangkok to Ulaanbaatar via Seoul. The return KE flight from ULN arrives at 04.00. . My connecting flight to Bangkok was at 09.35 so I had 5.5 hours at Incheon. The flight from ULN is only 3 hours so I had only about hours sleep and needed some more. The first time I did this trip I went straight to Terminal A from where Thai flights depart. However on arrival at the Asiana Business lounge I found a sign saying that it did not open until 6 am. I decided I would take a hotel room. However there are no transit hotel rooms in Terminal A (only in the Main Concourse) and once you are there you cannot get back to the Main Terminal. I was therefore forced to lie down on a row of to wait for the lounge to open. I do not believe I should have to do this at my age (60) especially when flying Business Class. I decided I would go to the transit hotel in Concourse A to get a few hours sleep. (Even in the Main Concourse the Asiana Lounge does not open until 5 am). However I needed a boarding pass (cannot be issued in ULN) so I asked at an information desk and was told that I get one at Transit Desk C which opened at 5 am. This meant that although I was checking into the transit hotel at 04.15 and was desperate for some sleep I could not go to sleep until I had obtained the boarding pass. At 5 am I went to the Transit Desk but was told that boarding passes for Thai flights could be issued at the Transit Desk F in Terminal A (not the information I was given previously). However if I went to Terminal A for my boarding pass I would not be able to get back to the Transit Hotel – backward trips not allowed for departing passengers. I was therefore forced to take the risk of not getting my boarding pass (and confirmation that luggage had been checked through) until just before the flight. I slept until 08.15 rushed to terminal A at 08.40 and got boarding pass about 50 minutes before flight departure.

I see that FlyBe operate a winter-sports charter to that lovely little airport at Berne (Belp) on Saturdays from Gatwick.

The check-in was quick but the security check had a long queue. It took me almost half an hour to get through this.

On the way out was pleasant and effective although quite slow but nothing to complain about. Nice transfer from Hilton by bus convenient and easy.

We used the e-passport gate which was poorly supervised and with one of the 5 out of order a lot slower than any other. Surely Stansted should have a much bigger number of these units given the growing number of e-passports and make sure they are well supervised! When I did use it the man at the front had to come out of his booth and ask me to get out of the booth because I had my bag on my shoulder it thought I was two people. In summary there is good reason why East Midlands Birmingham Luton and Heathrow remain head and shoulders above this airport. Maybe ownership has changed in 2013 but the management of the airport still seems poor and the infrastructure needs to get up to date with technology to stop looking like they are trying to fit a pint and a half into a pint pot. Small things could have made this delay well managed and the airport experience could have been positive but this is not what Stansted are good at.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,Matt Heinrich,NA,2010-01-23,"I've flown into and out of Denver several times. Since we live overseas we always arrive at Denver after at least 30 hours of traveling and late at night. However Denver is one of a few airports that I land at after a long trip and do not feel like I'm cramped stressed or outdated. The terminals are very large and spacious and allow a large amount of natural light to illuminate the area. Even during the height of the holiday season when there are hoards of people flocking to Denver the airport gives the sense that it is never really crowded. Even the train system is rarely jammed with people. Despite that the problem that always seems to hit me is that my bag is always delayed or lost. After traveling for 30+ hours the last thing you want to do is wait for your bag or even worse be told that it will be delivered the following day. My suggestion is that Denver needs to find a real solution to their baggage problems. The ""new"" system has been a complete failure and United will no longer be using it because of maintenance costs.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
nashville-airport,/airport-reviews/nashville-airport,Nashville Airport customer review,Tracy Janssen,NA,2006-06-30,Nashville is my home airport and while I must stifle a slight laugh about us being an 'international' airport I must say that my only 'bad' experience has been the slightly undermanned security line (or two). But in all my times flying out of Nashville I've only encountered bad security queues maybe twice. I find the parking to be easy - go Economy instead of long term (cheaper closer) and all the check in staff to be friendly. I've been flying international of late (BNA-ORD-LHR) and encounter almost no hassles. My only wish is for some sort of duty free shop and a currency exchange place with longer hours.

Upon arrival we had to use the buses to transport us from the plane to the airport building. Upon exiting the buses and entering the building one is greeted with long lines and chaos. Airport does have sections labelled (Pakistani citizens Foreigners and unaccompanied women) but everyone fails to adhere to these rules. There are two carousels but there efficiency is ridiculous. When exiting the airport they have random checks forcing people to place their luggage in scanners afterwards they require you to hand over the baggage claim receipts. When departing from Islamabad airport the process is even more tedious and annoying. You have to present your ticket or a print out to enter the airport. Then you head straight towards narcotics check instead of having scanners they make you open your luggage and create an appalling mess. Then its a series of scanners and checking after which you finally reach check-in desks immigration desks further checking random checking stamping of carry-on luggage and finally transit lounge on the second floor. The duty free shops offer restricted merchandise bathrooms are horrible (a daunting task to use them).

It is a long walk from the gate to the immigration check but there was no queue for European passport holders. Even for foreigners the queue was moving pretty fast. It took me less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration check which was impressive. Then I went to pick up my luggage and surprisingly they were waiting on the belt.

Thankfully our arrival at security was perfectly timed as whilst we didn't get stuck in the very lengthy queue ourselves we did see it snaking its way behind us as we made our way through to departure on Friday evening. Had we been 10 minutes later we would have got stuck at this stage ourselves. Unfortunately we weren't so lucky on our return last night! We were dismayed to reach the passport control hall to find a very long queue of people and only three officials dealing with those with EU passports. Thanks to the lack of officials and chaotic organisation which allowed for significant queue jumping it took 40 minutes for us to get through passport control.

(Having used Stansted regularly over the past 15 years before that) I noticed a steady decline in the airport. I couldn't be dropped outside the door of the airport anymore. Forced to pay £2 for 10 mins to park in the car park just to get my bags out. I have a leg injury and wasn't pleased that I had to walk all the way up to departures. The trolleys are coin operated and having spent the last of my change already had to go without. Check in was fairly smooth and friendly but then to security. Queues were unbelievably long. The line took 30 mins to get through. I am used to traveling and had my laptop already out of the bag etc but the security woman still insisted on asking me several times if I had a laptop. Through security I went to Starbucks to get a coffee staff were exceptionally rude making it clear that you were an inconvenience to them. The duty free and shop selection is quite good but flying Ryanair I couldn't buy anything with their strict cabin baggage allowance. I was disappointed at the lack of free wifi a facility I have encountered in the majority of airports across the world. £1 for 10 mins internet is excessive I think. A long walk to the gate and a lot of bag checking and weighing by Ryanair staff more sets of stairs and I was finally onboard. Glad to be leaving the airport and the stress behind. I am very disappointed at Stansted it used to be a lovely airport to fly from. It's extremely stressful now and the customer service in general is very poor.

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,J Bradley,NA,2009-01-06,Over the last couple of years the standards at Prestwick seem to have fallen to match those of the major no frills airline which supplies it with most of its business. From its shabby toilet facilities with cracked wash hand basins broken taps and peeling wall paint to the surly and rude security staff we encountered it provided a totally disappointing travel experience. On arrival at the airport we had to negotiate a ridiculously awkward pair of wooden swing doors at the entrance as none of the automatic doors appeared to be in working order. On to security who seemed genuinely annoyed that people were getting around the one small carry on bag rule by cramming hand bags etc into other bags or more ludicrously as the guy in front of me did by wearing three jackets. It is the only airport I have been through in the last 6 months which applies such a policy. The departure lounge was crammed with people and appears unable to cope with boarding more than one flight at a time. Their attempt to board three flights simultaneously when we were there descended into farce with people struggling to even reach the queue for their departure gate due to the crowds and confusion. My advice would be to stay landside as long as possible the dining and drinking area there is much more spacious and comfortable. In the years immediately following its revival Prestwick was a good airport and did what it did well. Whilst it may be content now to cater only to budget and seasonal charter airline business it should at least make an attempt to present itself as a reasonably comfortable place to spend a couple of hours rather than just a soul-less transit station,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Signage pretty poor not good in typical befuddled traveller state! But worst part of the airport was security. I've no idea what that head movement from the TSA operative meant somewhere between a nod/shake but apparently meant I was next of course I interpreted it slightly differently. (Hint: a simple ""next please"" would be fine). Then mum and I were herded into pre-checked lane (we weren't). I have absolutely no problem with taking shoes coats and belts off we had time to queue it's not a problem at all for me. Though it is a problem when there's no plastic trays to store your stuff in you're expected to throw loose items like your passport onto the conveyor and being the security conscious airport we all hope it is I thought it gave anyone the opportunity to just wander off with your belongings). Being UK citizens we're used to showing liquids exceeding 100ml in clear bags all of which had to be scooped up on exiting the conveyor. Throw into this mix the guy asking me in the quietest mumble ever to step through the scanner again after my belt set it off (I'd forgotten to remove it next to the sign reading ""do not remove belts coats or shoes""). As I did this I was told I wasn't listening. Apparently I had to wait as another traveller from a different queue stepped through in front of me. I would honestly rather be shouted at than left to second guess what the security operatives want me to do. Ask me clearly and concisely and I'll do it.

If passengers want to do shopping then check in at least 5 hrs before departure time as it takes longer to get all the formalities done and gates are at very far distance from immigration. The airport is full of all sorts of shops but no point if you are checking in just 3 hours before the flight time. There is no sign of small transportation vehicles to take the able bodied passengers to gates. The passengers were just rushing to their gates in order to catch their flights after security check.

oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,Erlend Serendahl,NA,2008-03-28,The public transportation to and from the city centre is quite expensive just like everything else in Norway. The airport express train takes either 19 or 22 minutes (depending on if it goes directly to Oslo Central Station or if it stops in Lillestrøm) and costs 160 NOK one-way. That is about $32. The train travels at 210 km/h. What some travellers don't know is that the regional or local train line run by the partly state-run train company NSB costs exactly half of what the airport express train does. This train takes 26 or 37 minutes (depending on if it is the regional line or the local). Both the regional and local line costs the same. The airport express train generally departs every ten minutes while the NSB trains run every 20 - 30 minutes. Keep in mind if you are below the age of 21 the price is the same for both the airport express and the NSB trains and you'll be better of with the airport express. Another option is the SAS flybussen (the SAS airport bus). This bus costs about $25 but it takes 45 minutes to the city centre. The last resort is to take a cab which costs a fortune. To the centre of town the fixed rate is about $130. I will strongly recommend you use the NSB trains as this is the cheapest and next fastest option.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

That's a sign that there's something wrong with your airport! When you arrive at MIA you have to walk several miles to get to the baggage carousel. It's a mess.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
bournemouth-airport,/airport-reviews/bournemouth-airport,Bournemouth Airport customer review,Jude Cox,United Kingdom,2011-10-29,Absurd drop off/pick up parking charges my husband has been down twice within a week to drop off and meet his sister from an Alicante flight and it's cost him £5.00 for a 5 minute favour. Totally disgusting. Southampton doesn't do this why does Bournemouth have to? There's going to be havoc with people walking to entrance to meet their lifts - what will the consequences be then?

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,H Resneck,United States,2013-08-01,Maybe it is true that most of the people that write reviews do it because they have a gripe. We are sitting at the gate at CDG in Terminal 2F having received excellent directions in English a very short wait at check-in and a quick trip through security and passport control. The directional signs are large very large easy to read and well located. All of the Air France personnel were polite and spoke English. Overall a pleasant experience and zero complaints. Perhaps the International Terminal has been upgraded but I didn't see any of the issues mentioned in the other reviews that raises some concerns about what our departure from France would be like. We typically arrive several hours early for an International flight and print our Boarding Passes the day prior to departure both of which makes life easier. Our flight departs at 10.30 am so it's not like we are getting on the first flight of the morning. And the terminal is air conditioned.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
las-vegas-airport,/airport-reviews/las-vegas-airport,Las Vegas Airport customer review,D Brushwood,United Kingdom,2013-04-28,Not overly impressed with this airport. We checked which took a while (Thomas Cook) to find that when we attempted to pas through security we were turned away because TC had not printed the boarding passes correctly this caused stress to quite a few passengers. Once through security we found terminal 3 lacking in eateries and shops (been in better local airports). You can smoke through security in the casino areas.,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
phnom-penh-airport,/airport-reviews/phnom-penh-airport,Phnom Penh Airport customer review,L Cronje,Cambodia,2011-10-12,PNH Airport has yet again been renovated lately in 2011 for the better. Everything is improving even airport taxes are now being included in most ticket prices for flights departing which is great especially if you forget to take extra cash with you or for visitors that wasn't informed. There are a few amenities at the airport nothing great but just enough to keep you occupied for the short while to boarding. I live in PNH from South Africa.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

pune-airport,/airport-reviews/pune-airport,Pune Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2007-12-24,The one thing that strikes me about this airport is that it's becoming woefully undersized for the amount of traffic coming to the city these days. Getting in the terminal isn't bad but once inside the security line snakes almost all the way back to the door (though in fairness it only took about 15 minutes to clear). Sitting space in the terminal area is also inadequate. My flight was at midday which you would think is a slow time of day traffic wise yet the waiting area was overflowing with people many sitting on the floor in any free space they could find. On the plus side the trip to the plane from the building is very short as is the taxi time. One thing to note - unlike at HYD MAA or the DEL domestic terminal the security guard at the terminal door checks your photo ID before allowing you inside the building. Not knowing this I had to fumble through my bag to get mine and my wife's which got me a rather unpleasant stare and what I presume were some choice words in Hindi.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Y Ren,Australia,2013-08-11,LCCT. It was my worst airport experience by far. First time flying AirAsia but probably the last time. It was nightmare. The whole terminal was chaotic. It felt and smelt like a fish market. Overcrowded disorganised and not enough signs. You need to go through scanning for your luggage first then check in counters. It was so disorganised. Nothing at waiting area not enough seats and dining options and very dirty. Then you will have a long march to the aircraft. Landing experience is not much better. First long march with no signs. Once you are outside the shed another chaotic parking and pick up experience. Our hotel car could not find us and did couple of laps around the airport we had to drag our luggage from one line to another. I would not recommend LCCT to anybody.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

zakynthos-airport,/airport-reviews/zakynthos-airport,Zakynthos Airport customer review,T Den by,NA,2008-09-17,Poor airport far too small for the volume of tourists that visit the island. We had to queue outside in the baking sun in what can only be described as canopied bus shelters because the terminal is not big enough to fit people in. Security was quite poor and check in was very old fashioned the place needs updated. When i was there they only had 1 small duty free shop and 1 cafe/food outlet which was horrible and expensive. The only had around 3 gates which were just doors out onto the runway. Its not very smart needs to be bigger needs modernising and i would hate to be delayed there. Nice island shame about the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
darwin-airport,/airport-reviews/darwin-airport,Darwin Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,NA,2009-10-07,"Flew in and out to and from Singapore on the way to Cairns - a bit of an uneven experience. The first time was early in the morning and most of the airport facilities were shut despite flights using the airport. Security screening into the transit lounge removed the water we had been given five minutes earlier on our Jetstar flight and there was no where to buy any more. On the way back we transited at Darwin for five hours and so went downtown by taxi ($22). Leaving the airport was easy and we were able to check our hand baggage at left luggage without trouble. Security was confusing on the way back you are first checked for everything other than ""the plastic bag"" which is then separately checked at another check point by staff some of whom have not learnt politeness. Although the airport is cramped and needs enlarging. there are far worse around. Duty Free is very expensive as are the cafes.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,M Ratcliffe,NA,2009-07-30,I have been thru Soekarna Hatta airport (CGK) many times and I can say that the departure immigration area has improved somewhat although not up to the standards of Singapore or KL. The check in areas are OK staff friendly and professional after immigration there are a number of eating outlets but mostly local food - not international considering this is Jakarta's main international airport its disapointing. Recently I noticed two internet terminals which were free - neither have worked since the many times I have tried to use them. The arrival areas are another story dingy dim and many officials standing around doing nothing. Immigration is Ok but at peak times the lines are long which also goes for the visa on arrival counters. The bags seem to take forever to arrive off the belt and then when you clear customs hoards of taxi touts who don't seem to understand the word NO! The airport needs major renovation.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
bahrain-airport,/airport-reviews/bahrain-airport,Bahrain Airport customer review,Abhinav Shrey,NA,2006-03-15,Arrived at Bahrain on 4th March '06 and left for Mumbai the same day. Got to spend some 4 hrs. there. Was quite good but the prices were sky- high. Definitely not less compared to other duty-free establishments. Though it was crowded the seating facilities were more or less OK. Even then there were lots of people sleeping on floor. There was just one junk food outlet and there was always a rush there. The best thing was the Ferrari's F1 car they had placed there in preparation for the coming Bahrain Grand Prix. The airport had a lively appearance because of it. There were lots of draws because of it too. There was a rush in the bus too while leaving for getting into my flight for Mumbai. The plane from Cairo had a direct connection to the airport by gangway. The guy at the boarding gate for Mumbai flight needs some coaching in manners!!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
davao-airport,/airport-reviews/davao-airport,Davao Airport customer review,A Flores,Singapore,2012-03-16,International flight from SG. Arrival quick but when passengers started to queue up for immigration the lights in the hall were switched off. The only thing that lit the hall was the sun from the windows. After 10 minutes of darkness someone finally realized they needed to turn on the lights. Departure was ok except for the time consuming queue for x-rays. Basic international airport. There's room for improvement.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
